These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities.</br>\n\n<br>The file will be updated daily and provides the latest values reported by each facility within the last four days. This allows for a more comprehensive picture of the hospital utilization within a state by ensuring a hospital is represented, even if they miss a single day of reporting.</br>\n\n<br>No statistical analysis is applied to account for non-response and/or to account for missing data.</br>\n\n<br>The below table displays one value for each field (i.e., column). Sometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to both HHS TeleTracking and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, deduplication is applied: specifically, HHS selects the TeleTracking record provided directly by the facility over the state-provided data to HHS Protect.</br>\n\n<br>On April 29, 2021, this data set has had the following fields added:\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_18-19\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_18-19_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_20-29_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_30-39\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_30-39_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_40-49\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_40-49_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_40-49_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_50-59\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_50-59_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_60-69\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_60-69_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_70-79\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_70-79_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_80+\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_80+_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_unknown\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_unknown_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_18-19\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_18-19_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_20-29\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_20-29_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_30-39\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_30-39_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_40-49\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_40-49_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_50-59\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_50-59_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_60-69\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_60-69_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_70-79\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_70-79_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_80+\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_80+_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_unknown\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_unknown_coverage\n</br>\n\n<br>On June 30, 2021, this data set has had the following fields added:\ndeaths_covid\ndeaths_covid_coverage\n</br>\n\n<br>On September 13, 2021, this data set has had the following fields added:\non_hand_supply_therapeutic_a_casirivimab_imdevimab_courses,\non_hand_supply_therapeutic_b_bamlanivimab_courses,\non_hand_supply_therapeutic_c_bamlanivimab_etesevimab_courses,\nprevious_week_therapeutic_a_casirivimab_imdevimab_courses_used,\nprevious_week_therapeutic_b_bamlanivimab_courses_used,\nprevious_week_therapeutic_c_bamlanivimab_etesevimab_courses_used\n</br>\n<br>On September 17, 2021, this data set has had the following fields added:\nicu_patients_confirmed_influenza,\nicu_patients_confirmed_influenza_coverage,\nprevious_day_admission_influenza_confirmed,\nprevious_day_admission_influenza_confirmed_coverage,\nprevious_day_deaths_covid_and_influenza,\nprevious_day_deaths_covid_and_influenza_coverage,\nprevious_day_deaths_influenza,\nprevious_day_deaths_influenza_coverage,\ntotal_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_influenza,\ntotal_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_influenza_and_covid,\ntotal_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_influenza_and_covid_coverage,\ntotal_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_influenza_coverage\n</br>"", ""Archive Repository"": ""https://healthdata.gov/d/4cnb-m4rz"", ""Contact Email"": ""HealthData@hhs.gov"", ""Language"": ""English"", ""Contact Name"": ""HealthData.gov Team"", ""Last Update"": ""2022-04-15 08:03"", ""Program Code"": ""009:028"", ""Publisher"": ""U.S. Department of Health & Human Services"", ""Is Quality Data"": ""true"", ""Bureau Code"": ""009:00"", ""Public Access Level"": ""public""}","{""updates"": {""Last Update"": ""2022-04-15 08:03""}, ""additions"": {}, ""deletions"": {}}","[{""name"": ""state"", ""dataTypeName"": ""text"", ""description"": ""1.
