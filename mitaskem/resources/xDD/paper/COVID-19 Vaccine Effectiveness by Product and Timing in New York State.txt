Whether declines in VE are due to waning immunity, t he Delta  variant , or \nother causes, is debated . \nMethods : We conducted a prospective study of 8,834,604 New York  adults, comparing vaccine cohorts \ndefined by product, age, and month of full -vaccination  to age-specific unvaccinated cohorts, by linking \nstatewide testing, hospital , and vaccine registry databases. VE was estimated  from May 1, 2021  for \nincident laboratory -confirmed COVID -19 cases (weekly life -table hazard rates through September 3) and \nhospitalizations (monthly incidence rates through August 31) . \nResults : 155,092 COVID -19 cases and 14,862  hospitalizations occurred . Estimated VE for cases declined \ncontemporaneously across age, products, and time -cohorts, from high levels beginning  May 1 (1.8% \nDelta variant prevalence), to a nadir around July 10 (85.3% Delta), with limited changes thereafter  (>95% \nDelta). Decreases were greatest  for Pfizer -BioNTech (-24.6%, -19.1%, -14.1% for 18 -49, 50 -64 years, and \n≥65 years, respectively), and similar for  Moderna ( -18.0%, -11.6%, -9.0%, respectively) and Janssen ( -\n19.2%, -10.8, -10.9%, respectively). VE for hospitalization  for adults 18-64 years was >86% across  \ncohorts , with out time trend . Among persons ≥65 years, VE declined  from May  to August  for Pfizer -\nBioNTech (95.0% to 89.2%) and Moderna (97.2% to 94.1%) . VE was lower for Ja nssen, with out trend , \nranging 85.5% -82.8 %. \nConclusions : Declines in VE for cases may have been primarily driven by factors other than waning. VE \nfor hospitalizations remained high, with modest declines  limited to Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna \nrecipients ≥65 years , supporting targeted booster dosing recommendations . \n \n  All rights reserved.

page_content='2 \n Introduction  \n \nIn New York State (NYS), over 2.4 million people have been diagnosed, and over 56,000 have \ndied, with COVID -19 through Sept 29 , 2021.1 COVID -19 vaccines are a critical prevention tool, with the \nthree currently FDA -approved or authorized products originally shown in trials to be highly -efficacious \nagainst moderate -severe disease among adults, with mRNA -BNT162b2 (Pfizer -BioNTech) at 95%, mRNA -\n1273 (Moderna) at 94%, and Ad26.COV2 (Janssen) at 72% efficacy.2-4  These studies’ endpoints were \nevaluated at relative ly short follow -up of 14 -28 days after series completion and during a period when \ncirculating strains were less transmissible than the currently -predominant Delta variant.5 \n More recently, extended trial follow -up and real -world effectiveness studies have begun to \ndocument declines in efficacy and vaccine effectiveness (VE), for some outcomes and populations, \nduring 2021. Studies in Israel documented larger declines in VE than observed in the U.S. for infection \nand severe disease among its Pfizer -receiving population, which may be due to earlier vaccination, \nincreased sensitivity definitions, or other methodological differences.6-9 U.S. population -based \neffectiveness studies in NYS and sentinel populations have documented declines in VE, particularly for \npersons ≥65 years , during the period in which the Delta variant became predominant and mitigation \nstrategies and policies were relaxed.10-14 The limitations of open cohort surveillance studies and limited \nnumbers of events in more controlled studies make it difficult to isolate  and quantify  the extent to \nwhich VE declines can be attributed to immunologic waning , Delta variant, behavioral changes , or other \ncauses , particularly across  subgroups defined by age, product, and risks for infection or severe illness .  \nData are urgently needed to understand the magnitude and sources of changes in VE, across \noutcomes, products, and population subgroups, to inform public health policy and vaccine \nrecommendations. Following  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizat ion, the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently recommended Pfizer -BioNTech booster doses for persons All rights reserved.

In the September  2021  advisory \nmeetings for FDA and CDC, gaps in U.S. VE data by age, time, and vaccine product were notable  and a \npoint of debate.17,18  \nTo address these gaps, we conducted a statewide cohort study to describe VE in NYS, in closed \ncohorts defined by product, age, and time of vaccination, from the time of the Delta variant’s \nemergence to predominance.  \n \nMethods  \nWe conducted a surveillance -based prospective cohort study of NY S adults, by linking statewide \nimmunization, laboratory testing, and hospitalization databases. Incident laboratory -confirmed COVID \ndiagnosis and hospitalization were ascertained among closed cohorts of vaccine recipients, defined by \nage, product, and timing of full -vaccination, during the pre - vs. post -Delta variant period from May 1 \n(<2%) to August 28, 2021 (>99%), and compared to the cohort of persons remaining unvaccinated.  \n \nData sources  \nFour databases were linked to construct a surveillance -based cohort of adults aged ≥18 years \nresiding in NYS.10 The Citywide Immunization Registry (CIR) and the NYS Immunization Information \nSystem (NYSIIS) are used to collect and store all COVID -19 provider vaccination data for persons residing \nin New York City and the rest of the state, respectively (excluding settings that report directly to the \nfederal system such as veterans, military, and first nations tribal  healthcare facilities).

Starting December 2020 , vaccine eligibility  sequentially \nexpanded  to priority groups, including th ose in long -term care facilities , healthcare workers , ≥65 years , \nfrontline  and essential  workers, and school staff , and those with co -morbidities (Table S1 ).  Closed \ncohorts were defined using persons fully -vaccinated  as of May 1, 2021, on the basis of age (18 -49, 50 -\n64, and ≥65 years) and vaccine product (Pfizer -BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen). Cohorts were defined \nbased on timing of full -vaccination (≥14 days after receipt of the final dose):  those fully -vaccinated in \nJanuary -February (Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna only), March, and April 2021.20 Whereas vaccinated \ncohorts were directly observed in NYSIIS/CIR, three synthetic age -specific unvaccinated comparison \ncohorts were defined as Census population minus persons parti ally or fully vaccinated on September 23 , \nwith case and hospitalization outcomes classified as unvaccinated if no matching COVID -19 vaccine was \nfound in NYSIIS/CIR.  \n \nStatistical  approach  \nFor the person -level cases outcome, the time to first new positive SARS -CoV-2 NAAT or antigen \ntest result (based on collection date) was assessed using the life -table method, with 7 -day time \nintervals, from the May 1 to August 28 weeks (ending September 3) .

Because the unit of observation was an \nadmission rather than person (approximately 9% of admissions estimated  non-unique on persons ), an \naggregate rates approach was used, as done elsewhere.10,11 For each product and age group, the \nincidence rates of new admissions per population, and exact Poisson 95% CI, were estimated overall by \ntime cohort monthly, given data sparse ness at the week -level. Incidence rate -ratios (IRR) and exact \nbinomial 95% CI compared each vaccinated cohort to the respective age -specific unvaccinated cohort, \nwith VE estimated as 1-IRR. \nTrends in VE for cases were graphically compared to the percentage  of specimens with the Delta \nvariant from the CDC national SARS -CoV-2 genomic surveillance program , for the HHS region containing \nNYS (data extracted 9/14/2021).5 The association between VE and the percentage Delta variant was \nsummarized using the Pearson correlation coefficient ( r) at each week, after each was linearized using \nthe logit transformation.  \n \nPrimary and sensitivity  analyses  \nIn the primary analysis, per sons with a positive laboratory result within 90 days before May 1 were \nconsidered not susceptible for either outcome and excluded , per the CDC case -definition .

Among a total \nof 8,834,604 adults in this analysis, 5,787,817 (65.5%) were fully -vaccinated. Among those fully -\nvaccinated, 48.6% received Pfizer, 41.5% Moderna, and 10.0% Jans sen. During follow -up, fully -\nvaccinated persons experienced a total of 38,778 cases and 2,363 hospitalizations and unvaccinated \npersons had 116,314 cases and 38,778 hospitalizations.  \n Inciden t cases  declined for all cohorts defined by age, vaccination status, vaccine product and \ntime cohorts from May 1 through late June and increased thereafter following increases in the \nprevalence of the Delta variant (Figure S1), with rates consistently highest for  the unvaccinated. Across \nproduct and time cohorts, estimated VE generally declined from highest levels during the week of May 1 \n(1.8% Delta variant) to a nadir around July 10 (85.3% Delta variant), with modest changes in following \nweeks (>95% Delta varian t) (Table 2, Figure 1).  \nFor persons 18 -49 years, VE for Pfizer -BioNTech declined 27.8% from 93.6% during the May 1 to \nJuly 10 weeks, and increased 3.2% by the August 28 week (net -24.6%, r between logit[VE] and logit[% \nDelta variant]  = -0.92, Table 1, Figu re 1a -c). Similarly, Moderna VE decreased 19.3% from 96.5%, then \nincreased 1.3% (net -18.0%, r = -0.94). For Janssen, VE decreased 37.7% from 89. 4%, then increased \n18.5% (net -19.2%, r = -0.76), with less stable estimates. Differences within product betwee n time \ncohorts were smaller over time. At the end of observation, VE ranged 4.2% across time cohorts for \nPfizer, 11.0% for Moderna, and 4.9% for Janssen.  \nFor persons 50 -64 years, VE for Pfizer -BioNTech decreased 23.8% from 95.3% during  May 1 to \nJuly 10, and increased 4.7% by August 28 (net –19.1%, r between logit[VE] and logit[% Delta variant]  = -\n0.93, Figure 1d -f). Similarly , Moderna VE decreased 11.6% from 97.4%, then decreased 2.9% (net -\n14.4%, r = -0.95).

At the end of observation, VE ranged 4.0% across time cohorts for Pfizer, 11.1% for Moderna, and \n8.0% for Janssen, with a gradient of lower VE point estimates for earlier -vaccinated cohorts.  \nAmo ng persons ≥65 years, VE for Pfizer -BioNTech decreased 12.7% from 91.9% during May 1 to \nJuly 10, and decreased 1.4% by August 28 (net -14.1%, r between logit[VE] and logit[% Delta variant]  = -\n0.95, Figure 1g -i). Likewise, Moderna VE decreased 9.0% from 96.2%, then decreased 2.9% (net -11.9%, r \n= -0.97). For Janssen, VE decreased 2.4% from 81.7%, then decreased 8.4% (net -10.9%, r = -0.65 ). At the \nend of observation, VE ranged 3.2% across tim e cohorts for Pfizer, 6.7% for Moderna, and 6.7% for \nJanssen, with lower VE point estimates for earlier -vaccinated cohorts.  \nHospitalization rates also generally declined for all cohorts from May to June, then increased \nthrough August, with rates highest fo r the unvaccinated and those ≥65 years. (Figure S2). For persons in \nthe 18 -49 and 50 -64 age cohorts who received Pfizer -BioNTech or Moderna, VE for hospitalization was \n>90% for every month and time -cohort, except June among persons 18 -49 years fully -vaccin ated in April \nwith Moderna (87.3%), with no clear time trend (Table 3, Figure 2a -f). Janssen recipients aged 18 -49 had \n>90% VE except in June among those fully -vaccinated in March (53.7%).  VE for Janssen recipients aged \n50-64 ranged 86.6 -93.3%.  \nAmong pers ons ≥65 years, hospitalization VE estimates declined for Pfizer -BioNTech recipients \nfrom May (93.2% for January/February, 95.8% for March, 95.2% for April cohorts) to August (86.2%, \n89.6%, 90.3% respectively). Smaller declines were observed for Moderna rec ipients from May (97.4% for \nJanuary/February, 96.1% for March, 95.9% for April cohorts) to August (93.2%, 94.1%, 94.3% \nrespectively).

page_content='8 \n Sensitivity analyses  \nIn analyses that considered alternative population sizes for the unvaccinated, VE for cases \nchanged medians of -3.6% when adjusting for census uncertainty and -1.6% when using the entire \npopulation size (Table S2 -3). VE for hospitalization changed  medians of -0.9% when adjusting for census \nuncertainty, -0.4% when using the entire unvaccinated population size, +2.3% when limiting to \nhospitalizations “for COVID -19”, and -0.4% when using the time -defined cohort sizes without exclusions \napplied  (Table S4 -7).  \n \nDiscussion  \nBy analyzing large cohorts of NYS residents, we observed substantial declines in VE for COVID -19 \ncases from May to August 2021. These declines occurred simultaneously across age, product, and time -\ncohort, with the largest declin es seen for Pfizer -BioNTech recipients. VE declines by time -cohort were \nnot offset in calendar time by approximately one -month, which would have suggested  immunologic \nwaning. However , trends in VE were highly inversely -correlated with increasing Delta vari ant prevalence \nand plateaued for persons 18 -64 years during the period in which Delta exceeded 85%. VE continued to \nmodestly decline for persons ≥65 years. In contrast, VE for hospitalizations remained high, with lower \nlevels for persons ≥65 years and thos e receiving Janssen , and modest declines over time within  -6%, \nlimited to Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna recipients ≥65 years .  \nDeclines in VE for COVID -19 cases during July 2021  followed by a plateau in late summer have \nbeen reported recently by multiple jurisdictions using overall rate comparisons between open cohorts.22-\n24 These observations could also reflect changes in the population vaccinated, in terms of newly -\nvaccinated persons entering and differences in the distribution of products recei ved and changes in the \npopulation unvaccinated. Other recent studies have shown VE changes in pre - vs. post -Delta eras in \nmore well -controlled designs, but with less temporal resolution and outcomes observed.13,14 A strength All rights reserved.

page_content='9 \n of this work is the use of clos ed cohorts to control for the challenges posed by previous surveillance -\nbased approaches to demonstrate consistency in these patterns for VE. Compared to more targeted \nstudies, this study more precisely aligns patterns in time with population -level changes  in the Delta \nvariant. The apparent lower set -point for VE after population -level saturation of the Delta variant may \nreflect its increased transmissibility.25  \nPolicy  changes co -occurred with, and were in part responding to, changes in the epidemic driven  \nby the Delta variant and  availability of vaccines.  On May 19, 2021, NYS adopted the CDC guidance for \nfully -vaccinated persons, followed in June by the end of NYS’ state of emergency, which reduced mask -\nwearing , distancing  and other prevention practices.26 On July 27, 2021, CDC recommended mask usage \nfor fully -vaccinated persons based on transmission levels.27 Time -dependent changes in prevention \npolicies and behaviors by vaccination status could contribute to observed t rends; the modest VE \nincreases observed for some groups in August may reflect such changes.  \n Our results provide evidence of immunity loss associated with time since completion of \nvaccination. For most groups, we observed gradients by time -cohort in August , whereby more recently -\nvaccinated cohorts had  higher VE for cases, particularly for Moderna recipients, and continued declines \nthat month for all cohorts of persons ≥65 years. Declines in VE for hospitalization of <10% were seen for \npersons ≥65 years, par ticularly those receiving Pfizer -BioNTech and in the January/February cohort. \nThese findings are consistent with recent findings of reduced VE for severe disease in older populations, \nparticularly those living in long -term care facilities (LTCF), and who r eceived Pfizer.8,12,28 Because the \nfederal LTCF vaccine distribution program primarily distributed Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine to NYS, the \nJanuary/February cohort for Pfizer -BioNTech is more  enriched for this population, potentially \ncontributing to  the decline  observed in that group.

page_content='10 \n Irrespective of the cause or propensity for continued declines in VE, our findings have important \nimplications for national vaccine policy. Pfizer -BioNTech booster doses have been demonstrated safe \nand to increase short -term protec tion against the Delta variant.29 Our findings align with the CDC \nrecommendation for Pfizer -BioNTech boosters in persons ≥65 years.16 The booster recommendation for \n18-64 years in high -exposure occupations was against the vote of ACIP members, who cited limited \nsupportive data on VE for persons <65 years. This study addresses key U.S. data gaps, demonstrating \npopulation -wide declines in VE for infection to <85% and smaller changes in VE for severe disease \nlimited to persons ≥65 years receiving mRNA vaccines. This suggests a focus on booster shots for those \n>65 years is warranted, with only limited need for booster expansion beyond that age group for the \npurposes of reducing severe COVID -19. \n \nLimitations  \nOur estimates of VE may be influenced by unmeas ured confounding due to behavioral, medical, \nor exposure differences between fully -vaccinated and unvaccinated adults .10,11 This potential bi as come s \nin exchange for large sample sizes and outcome numbers that exceed those of other nations’ studies \nand of smaller, more controlled designs.6,7,13,14 Our findings are further strengthened by broad age \nrepresentation across time -cohorts and the consistency of changes in calendar time.  \nThis study  did not account for indirect effects (e.g. herd -immunity -type) between groups. The \nsurvival analytic approach for cases required persons to have no diagnosis 90 days before May 1, \nconsistent with case -definitions. In this interval between Winter and Summer 2021 COVID -19 waves , \nunder 1% of persons fully -vaccinated through April 30 received a diagnosis before or after vaccination \nand were excluded initially and throughout the analysis, due to the closed -cohort design. The weekly -\ncalculated conditional hazard function was thus ne gligibly affected by such persons.

Finally, it is unclear the extent to which earlier SARS -CoV-2 infection modifies \nvaccine effectiveness; future research may explore effect modification by prior diagnostic history.30 \n \nConclusions  \nWe observed declines in VE for cases contemporaneous with increased Delta variant prevalence, \nand changes in prevention policies, with little variation in timing by age, product, or time -cohort, \nsuggesting these changes may be primarily driven by factors other than immunological waning.
