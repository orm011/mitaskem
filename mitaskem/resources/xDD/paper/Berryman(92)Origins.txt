THE  ORIGINS  AND  EVOLUTION  OF PREDATOR-PREY  THEORY '

Abstract. Predator—prey  theory  is  traced  from  its  origins  in  the  Malthus-Verhulst  /o- gistic  equation,  through  the  Lotka-Volterra  equations,  /ogistic  modifications  to  both  prey and  predator  equations,  incorporation  of  the  Michaelis-Menten-Holling  functional  response into  the  predator  and  prey  equations,  and  the  recent  development  of  ratio-dependent functional  responses  and  per-capita  rate  of  change  functions.  Some  of  the  problems  of classical  predator-prey  theory,  including  the  paradoxes  of  enrichment  and  biological  con- trol,  seem  to  have  been  caused  by  the  application  of  the  principle  of  mass  action  to  predator— prey  interactions.  Predator—prey  models  that  evolved  from  /ogistic  theory  or  that  incor- porate  ratio-dependent  functional  responses  do  not  have  these  problems  and  also  seem  to be  more  biologically  plausible. Key  words: logistic;  Lotka-  Volterra;  predator-prey  interactions;  ratio  dependence.
INTRODUCTION
The  dynamical  relationship  between  predators  and their  prey  is  one  of  the  dominant  themes  in  ecology. Yet  the  theory  of  predator—prey  interactions  has  some notable  problems:  One  is  the  “‘paradox  of  enrichment,”’ where  classical  models  predict  that  enriching  the  sys- tem  will  cause  an  increase  in  the  equilibrium  density of  the  predator  but  not  in  that  of  the  prey  (Hairston, Smith,  and  Slobodkin  1960),  and  will  destabilize  the community  equilibrium  (Rosenzweig  1969).  These predictions,  however,  are  not  always  in  line  with  field observations  (Arditi  and  Ginzburg  1989,  Arditi  et  al. 1991,  Ginzburg  and  Akcakaya  1992).  Another  is  the ‘biological  control  paradox”?  (Luck  1990,  Arditi  and Berryman  1991),  where  classical  models  predict  that you  cannot  have  both  a  very  low  and a  stable  pest (prey)  equilibrium  density,  yet  there  are  numerous  ex- amples  of  predator  and  parasite  introductions  (classical biological  control)  that  have  resulted  in  exotic  pests being  maintained  at  sparse  and  apparently  stable  den- sities  (Turnbull  and  Chant  1961,  DeBach  1974,  Hagen and  Franz  1973). Recently  there  has  been  renewed  interest  in  what  is being  called  ratio-dependent  predator—prey  theory  (Ar- diti  and  Ginzburg  1989,  Berryman  1990).  Although ratio-dependent  predator—prey  models  are  not  new,  they have  not  previously  occupied  a  central  place  in  eco- logical  theory.  Yet  they  solve  many  of  the  problems  of more  conventional  models,  including  the  paradoxes  of enrichment  and  biological  control  (Arditi  and  Ginz-

burg  1989,  Arditi  and  Berryman  1991).  In  this  paper I  briefly  sketch  the  origin  and  evolution  of  population theory  and,  in  particular,  predator-prey  models.  My objectives  are  twofold:  First,  to  show  how  conventional predator—prey  models  deviated  significantly  from  ear- lier  theory,  and  how  this  may  have  led  to  some  of  their problems.  Second,  to  show  how  ratio-dependent  pred- ator—prey  theory  follows  logically  from  basic  concepts of  single-species  population  dynamics,  and  how  this viewpoint  solves  many  of  the  problems  and  paradoxes of  traditional  predator—prey  theory.
MALTHUS-VERHULST  LOGISTIC  THEORY
The  first  definitive  theoretical  treatment  of  popula- tion  dynamics  was  Thomas  Malthus’  (1798)  Essay  on the  Principle  of Population.  Malthus  argued  that,  while populations  grow  logarithmically,  the  resources  on which  they  depend  remain  constant  or  only  increase arithmetically.  Thus,  the  demand  for  resources  must eventually  exceed  the  supply  and  population  growth, being  dependent  on  the  resource  supply,  must  then cease.  Forty  years  later,  Verhulst  (1838)  formed  Mal- thus’  “principle  of  population”  into  a  mathematical model—the  /ogistic  equation dN/at  =  aN(\  —  N/K), (1)
dN/at  =  aN(\  —  N/K), (1)
where  JN is  the  biomass  density  of  the  population  in question,  @  is  its  maximum  per-capita  rate  of  change, or  the  instrinsic  rate  of  increase,  and  K  is  the  equilib- rium  density,  often  called  the  carrying  capacity  of  the environment.  Although  this  equation  is  often  criticized for  its  oversimplicity,  it  remains  the  central  theoretical

construct  for  single-species  population  dynamics  and, when  generalized  to  account  for  discrete  growth  pro- cesses,  time-delayed  and  nonlinear  density  depen- dence,  and  multiple  domains  of  attraction,  it  describes the  dynamics  of  many  single-species  populations  in both  laboratory  and  field  (Gause  1934,  Allee  et al. 1949,  Thomas  et al.  1980,  Berryman  and  Millstein 1990).
LOTKA-VOLTERRA  PREDATOR—PREY  THEORY Lotka’s  Elements  of  Physical  Biology  (Lotka  1925) was  the  next  major  advance  in  population  dynamics theory.  Not  only  did  Lotka  derive  the  /ogistic  equation, which  he  called  the  “‘law  of  population  growth,”  from first  principles,  but  he  also  proposed  the  first  model  of trophic  (predator—prey)  interactions.  However,  instead of  developing  the  predator—prey  model  by  extending the  /ogistic  “law”?  to  two  species  he,  and  soon  after- wards  Volterra  (1928,  as  translated  in  Chapman  1931), adopted  the  chemical  principle  of  mass  action.  In  other words,  he  assumed  that  the  response  of  the  populations would  be  proportional  to  the  product  of  their  biomass densities  so  that
adN/dt  =  aN  —  bNP, (2a) aP/dt  =  cNP  —  aP, (2b)
where  N  and  P  are  the  biomass  densities  of  prey  and predator,  respectively,  a  and  dare  their  per-capita  rates of  change  in  the  absence  of  each  other,  and  b  and  c  are their  respective  rates  of  change  due  to  interaction.  This application  of  the  principle  of  mass  action  seems  to have  been  the  point  where  predator-prey  theory  de- viated  from  classical  (/ogistic)  thinking,  and  where  sub- sequent  theorizing  may  have  been  misled. Shortly  after  publication  of  the  Lotka-Volterra  equa- tions,  Nicholson  and  Bailey  (1935)  proposed  a  dis- crete-time  model  of  the  interaction  between  insect parasitoids  and  their  hosts.  Although  this  model  was developed  from  the  more  mechanistic  perspective  of parasitoid  search  behavior,  it  is  identical  in  concept  to the  Lotka-Volterra  model  (Royama  1971). The  zero-growth  isoclines  of  the  Lotka-Volterra equations,  obtained  by  setting  their  left-hand  sides  to zero,  are  perpendicular  to  the  axis  of  the  other  species (Fig. la).  Solutions  of  the  differential  equations  (Eqs. 2)  form  a  series  of  closed  ellipses  that  depend  critically on  the  initial  conditions  (neutrally  stable  limit  cycles). In  the  more  reasonable  discrete-time  (Nicholson-Bai- ley)  form,  however,  the  model  has  an  unstable  solution; 1.e.,  the  community  equilibrium  is  an  unstable  focus (similar  to  the  trajectory  shown  in  Fig. la).  A  great deal  of  theoretical  effort  has  gone  into  stabilizing  the Nicholson-Bailey  equations;  i.e.,  by  incorporating  in-
terference  between  searching  predators,  spatial  hetero- geneities,  polyphagy,  etc.  (Hassell  1978).
INCURSIONS  OF  LOGISTIC  THEORY In  the  original  Lotka-Volterra  equations,  the  prey population  grows  infinitely  in  the  absence  of  predators. To  correct  this  unreasonable  assumption,  a  /ogistic  self- limitation  term  is  often  added  to  the  prey  equation, dN/dt  =  aN(1  —  N/K)  —  BNP. (3a) This  modification  produces  an  isocline  structure  sim- ilar  to  that  shown  in  Fig.  |b  and  stabilizes  the  system (the  equilibrium  is  now a stable  focus). It  is  interesting  that  Volterra  (1928,  as  translated  in Chapman  1931)  and  Gause  (1934)  both  used  the  /o- gistic  equation  as  the  underlying  structure  for  their  two- species  competition  models,  but  failed  to  consider  it as  a  suitable  framework  for  modeling  predator—prey interactions.  Leslie  (1948)  seems  to  have  been  the  first to  consider  a  /ogistic  predator  equation dP/dt  =  cP(1  —  eP/N), (3b) where  e  is  the  density  of  prey  required  to  maintain  a single  predator  and  to  replace  it  with  one  offspring when  it  dies.  In  other  words,  e  is  the  marginal  subsis- tence  demand  for  prey,  1/e  is  the  marginal  reproductive value  of  the  resource,  and  W/e  is  the  carrying  capacity of  predators  when  provided  with  a  constant  supply  of prey.  Leslie’s  equation  seems  to  be  the  first  time  that predator/prey  ratios  (P/N)  rather  than  products  (NP) are  seen  in  models  of  trophic  relationships.  The  system of  predator-prey  equations  (Eqs.  3)  has  an  isocline structure  similar  to  that  shown  in  Fig. Ic,  with  the community  equilibrium  a  stable  focus.  Notice  that  the predator  isocline  is  slanting  rather  than  vertical.  This new  isocline  structure  seems  to  be  intuitively  reason- able  because  predator  equilibrium  densities  are  ex- pected  to  be  dependent  on  prey  abundance  (see  e.g., Berryman  1981,  Arditi  and  Ginzburg  1989).  In  addi- tion,  the  slanting  predator  isocline  solves  the  paradoxes of  enrichment  and  biological  control  (Arditi  and  Ginz- burg  1989,  Arditi  and  Berryman  1991).
PREDATOR  FUNCTIONAL  RESPONSES The  next  major  contribution  to  the  theory  of  pred- ator/prey  interactions  was  the  addition  of  a  predator functional  response.  Solomon  (1949)  and  Holling  (1959, 1966)  argued  that,  because  predators  can  only  handle a  finite  number  of  prey  in a  unit  of  time,  the  prey  death rate  should  be  a  nonlinear  function  of  prey  density; 1.€.,
dN/dt  =  aN(\  —  N/K)  —  B(N)P, (4a) where  5(N)  is  the  functional  response  of  the  predator to  prey  density.  Based  on a  series  of  elegant  behavioral

experiments,  in  which  predators  (sometimes  blind- folded  students)  searched  for  different  densities  of  prey (sometimes  sandpaper  disks),  Holling  derived  his  fa- mous  “‘disk”’  equation  which  turned  out  to  be  identical to  the  well-known  Michaelis-Menten  equation  of  en- zyme  kinetics  (Real  1977);  1.e., b(N)  =  mN/(w  +  N), (5) where  m  is  the  maximum  predator  attack  rate  and  w is  the  prey  density  where  the  attack  rate  is  half-satu- rated.  The  Michaelis-Menten-Holling  equation  can  be extended  to  account  for  general  predators  that  switch from  one  prey  species  to  another  (sigmoid  functional responses)  (Real  1977).  When  the  functional  response is  included  in  the  prey  equation,  we  obtain  the  para- bolic  (humped)  prey  isoclines  (Rosenzweig  1971)  that are  characteristic  of  ratio-dependent  prey  equations (Fig.  1d);  note  that  the  functional  response  introduces ratio-dependence  into  the  prey  equation  because,  when w  is  set  to  zero  as  in  Fig.  |,  the  per-capita  death  rate of  the  prey  becomes  mP/N. On  the  argument  that  the  prey  deaths  can  be  directly translated  into  predator  births,  functional  responses are  often  employed  in  predator  equations;  1.e., dP/dt  =  cP[mMN/(w  +  N)]  —  aP. (4b) However,  this  formulation  gives  rise  to  the  primitive rectilinear  Lotka-Volterra  predator  isocline  from  which arise  the  paradoxes  of  enrichment  and  biological  con- trol  (cf.  Fig.  la  and  d).  Nevertheless,  the  isocline  struc- ture  shown  in  Fig.  1d  has  been  employed  extensively in  the  development  of  modern  predator—prey  theory (Rosenzweig  and  MacArthur  1963,  MacArthur  and Connell  1966).
RATIO-  DEPENDENT  FUNCTIONAL  RESPONSES Although  the  inclusion  of  a  functional  response  in the  predator-prey  model  is  intuitively  appealing,  be- cause  it  conservatively  couples  the  prey  and  predator equations,  there  are  some  notable  problems  with  this approach.  For  instance,  the  functional  response  de- scribes  the  behavior  of  searching  predators  on  a  fast (behavioral)  time  scale  (minutes  or  hours),  whereas  the population  equation,  into  which  it is  inserted,  often operates  on  a  slower  (population  dynamical)  time  scale (days  or  years).  To  overcome  this  problem,  Arditi  and Ginzburg  (1989)  suggest  that,  in  cases  where  the  time scales  are  incongruent,  the  functional  response  should be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  ratio  of  prey  to  predators; e.g.,  the  Holling  Type  II  functional  response  should  be written
b(N/P)  =  m(N/P)Y(w  +  N/P)  =  mN/(WP  +N). (6) A  similar  feeding  equation  was  proposed  previously
by  DeAngelis  et  al.  (1975).  When  inserted  into  classical predator-prey  models,  this  ratio-dependent  functional response  produces  a  parabolic  prey  isocline  and  right- slanting  predator  isocline  (Fig.  le),  thereby  solving  the paradoxes  of  enrichment  and  biological  control  (Arditi and  Ginzburg  1989,  Arditi  and  Berryman  1991).
THE  PER-CAPITA  VIEWPOINT Berryman  (1981)  and  Getz  (1984)  have  argued  that, because  population  dynamics  arise  from  interactions between  individual  organisms,  the  equations  should  be derived  as  per-capita  rates  of  change.  For  example,  we could  write  the  following  general  ratio-dependent  per- capita  trophic  equation, dN,/Ndt  =  R,  =  a,  —  f(N/N,.,)  —  g(N,.,/N), (7)
where  WN,  is  the  biomass  density  of  the  i'®  species  in  a trophic  chain,  R,  is  the  per-capita  rate  of  change  of  that species,  a,  is  its  maximum  per-capita  rate  of  change  in a  given  physical  environment,  f,  defines  the  interaction between  the  species  and  the  lower  trophic  level  (its prey)  as  a  function  of  the  predator/prey  ratio,  and  g, defines  its  interaction  with  the  higher  trophic  level  (its predator),  also  as  a  function  of  the  predator/prey  ratio. Using  the  type  II  functional  response  (Eq.  5)  for  fand g,  we  can  obtain  an  explict  per-capita  trophic  equation (see  Appendix),
R;  =  a;  ~  bN,/(™,_  |  +  N,_1)  —  CN:  41  /(,  +  N)), (8)
where  5b,  defines  the  effect  of  intra-specific  competition for  food  on  the  per-capita  rate  of  change  (f  reduces  to the  classical  /ogistic  when  w; , +  N,_,  =  a  constant; see  Appendix),  c,;  is  a  coefficient  of  vulnerability  defin- ing  the  effect  of  predation  on  the  per-capita  rate  of change,  and  w,  is  the  biomass  density  of  all  other  food species  in  the  /""  trophic  level.  Notice  that  the  per-capita viewpoint  clarifies  the  ecological  meaning  of  the  func- tional  response  parameter  w,,  previously  called  the “half-saturation”’  point;  1.e.,  it  defines  the  quantity  of alternative  food  available  to  the  predator.  Because  the denominators  of  the  predator/prey  ratios  in  (Eq.  8) contain  all  the  prey  species  available  to  each  predator, while  the  predators  utilizing  that  food  are  contained in  the  numerators,  it  is  fairly  straightforward  to  extend this  equation  to  food  webs  with  many  species  in  each trophic  level. It is  worth  noting  that,  although  simple  per-capita equations  are  nonlinear  in  respect  to  their  variables, they  are  linear  in  their  ratios  and,  therefore,  can  be  fit to  data  with  standard  regression  techniques  (Berryman 1990).  In  this  way,  model  parameters  can  be  estimated a  posteriori  from  time-series  data,  such  as  might  be obtained  from  annual  surveys  or  harvest  records.  For

example,  the  per-capita  rate  of  change  of  each  species can  be  estimated  from  the  relationship R,  =  1/N-dN/at  =  d\n  N/dt  =  \n(N,/N,_,), (9)
R,  =  1/N-dN/at  =  d\n  N/dt  =  \n(N,/N,_,), (9)
and  this  can  be  regressed  against  the  predator/prey ratios  (Eq.  8).  These  models  can  then  be  used  to  predict future  population  trends  or  to  simulate  resource  or  pest management  policies  (Berryman  1991);  1.e.,  they  have practical  utility.
CONCLUSIONS
Unlike  the  theoretical  models  of  inter-specific  com- petition  and  mutualism,  which  emerged  directly  from the  theory  of  /ogistic  single-species  population  dynam- ics,  the  original  Lotka-Volterra  predator-prey  equa- tions  were  built  around  the  principle  of  mass  action; 1.e.,  the  responses  were  assumed  to  be  proportional  to the  product  rather  than  the  ratio  of  population  densi- ties.  Predator  equations  derived  in  this  way  have  ver- tical  isoclines,  leading  to  the  paradoxes  of  enrichment and  biological  control. The  inclusion  of  a  predator  functional  response  in the  Lotka-Volterra  model  corrected  the  unreasonable assumption  of  unsaturating  attack  rates.  However,  the primitive  rectilinear  predator  isocline  remained,  and so  also  the  paradoxes  of  enrichment  and  biological control.  This  problem  was  solved  by  making  the  func- tional  response  depend  on  prey/predator  ratios  rather than  prey  densities  alone. Per-capita  predator/prey  models  evolve  naturally from  classical  /ogistic  theory.  Such  models  have  slant- ing  predator  isoclines,  contain  implicit  functional  re- sponses  (see  Appendix),  and  solve  the  paradoxes  of enrichment  and  biological  control.  In  addition,  they offer  parsimonious  descriptions  of  predator/prey  in- teractions,  and  can  easily  be  extended  to  multi-species food  webs.  It  may  also  be  significant  that  /ogistic  mod- els  emerge  from  the  reduction  and  simplification  of detailed  physiological  and  behavioral  predator—prey models  (Rapport  and  Turner  1975,  Gutierrez  1992). The  main  criticism  that  has  been  levelled  at  /ogistic (per-capita)  predator/prey  models  is  that  they  may  not strictly  conform  to  the  laws  of  conservation  (Ginzburg and  Akcakaya  1992);  i.e.,  the  equations  are  not  ex- plicitly  coupled  by  the  biomass  of  prey  killed,  as  are conventional  models.  However,  it  may  be  overly  re- strictive  to  insist  that  predator/prey  models  adhere strictly  to  the  laws  of  conservation.  After  all,  prey  death is  not  always  necessary  for  predator  reproduction.  For example,  true  parasites  and  most  organisms  that  feed on  plants  do  not  kill  their  hosts,  but  they  may  reduce fertility,  fecundity,  and  growth  rates.  Insistence  on  con- formity  to  the  laws  of  conservation  may,  therefore, unnecessarily  constrain  the  development  of  a  general theory  of  predator-prey  interactions.

APPENDIX The  type  II  functional  response  (Eq.  5)  defines  the  attack aP/Pdt  =  c(i —  eP/N), rate  per  predator  supplied  with  N  prey,  so  for  P  predators  the R,  = —  bPIN, with  b  =  ce. prey  death  rate  is  mNP/(w  +  N).  Dividing  by  N  gives  the  per- capita  death  rate  mP/(w  +  N)  which,  after  relabelling,  can  be For  a  single  predator  foraging  for  prey  in  an  arena,  this  be- comes substituted  for f, and  g,  in  Eq.  7  to  give  Eq.  8.  It  is  important to  note  that  the  first  per-capita  functional  response  (f  in  Eq. R,  =c  —  bI/N, 7)  reduces  to  the  classical  /ogistic  when  the  lower  trophic  level is  constant;  e.g.,  a  constant  input  of  sunlight  for  plants.  Under which  has  an  identical  form  to  the  type  II  functional  response; this  condition,  w,_,  +  N,_,  =a  constant  =  E,_,,  and  E,_,/b, L.e.,  R,  +  —o  as  N  ~  Oand  R,  —  cas  N  >  oc.  Equivalency =  K,_,,  the  equilibrium  density  or  carrying  capacity  of  the between  the  /ogistic  equation  and  the  functional  response  oc- environment.  Leslie  (1948)  demonstrated  this  implicit  func- curs  if  the  per-capita  rate  of  change  of  the  predator  is  assumed tional  response  within  the  /ogistic  equation;  e.g.,  if  we  write to  be  directly  proportional  to  the  number  of  prey  eaten,  a  not the  per-capita  logistic  predator  equation  (Eq.  3b) unreasonable  proposition.
