page_content='Time -Varying COVID -19 Reproduction Number in the United States  \n2 \n Introduction  \n \nThe basic reproduction number is the average number of people to whom an infected person \ntransmits the infection when virtually all individuals in a population are susceptible.  A \nreproduction number greater than 1.0 means an epidemic is growing while a nu mber less than \n1.0 means an epidemic is slowing down and may eventually end.  The reproduction number for \nthe novel coronavirus responsible for COVID -19 was estimated to be 2.2 in Hubei Province, \nChina, based on cases in December 2019 and January 2020.(1)  Following one month of social \ndistancing and lockdown, the reproduction number decreased to 1.6.(2)   We sought to calculate \nthe current reproduction number for each state in the United States.   \n \nMethods  \n \nWe used data on the number of daily cases as compiled by the New York Times from federal, \nstate, and local sources to estimate reproduction number for the most recent day, one week \nearlier, a nd two weeks earlier .(3)  This estimation requires information on the distribution of the \nserial interval, i.e . the time between symptom onset in an infector -infectee pair.  We utilized \nserial interval data reported in China  and truncated negative values and values greater than 20 \ndays as unrealistic .(4) We identified the best function as a gamma distribution with  a mean of \n4.5 and a standard deviation of 4.3 days and calculated time dependent  daily reproduction  \nnumbers  over a 14 day interval  using  the approach  proposed  by Wallinga  & Teunis  with a \nBayesian  modification  for real-time estimation .(4-6)  All analyses  were  performed  with R \nstatistical  software  and R0 and projections  packages . \n \nResults  \n \nFor the entire United States, the reproduction number declined from 4.02 to 1.51 over the last \ntwo weeks  (Table) .  Individual states varied greatly in their current reproduction number and \ntrajectory over the last two week s.  For example, Ohio ’s reproduction number  declined from \n3.97 to 1.62.  By contrast, Louisiana had a more gradual decline and had a reproduction \nnumber on April 1 of 2.22.   \n \nEven small differences in reproduction number can have sizeable effects.  For example, Ohio \nwill be projected to have 3500 incident cases in three weeks if the current reproduction number All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The projected number of cases would be 1400 with a reproduction number of \n1.40 and 6500 with a reproduction number of 1.80.  \n \nDiscussion  \n \nSeveral factors influence the value of the reproduction number, including how contagious an \ninfectious organism is, how many susceptible people there are  and their prox imity to each other , \nand what measures are implemented to limit spread.  We found that the reproduction number \nfor COVID -19 has declined in most states over the past two weeks  which suggests that social \nisolation measures may be having a beneficial effect .  However, most states still have \nreproduction number s substantially higher  than 1.0 .  That means it would be premature to relax \nrestrictions and resume normal social and economic activities.  Doing so now will result in an \nincrease in the reproduction num ber and a surge of new cases.   Examining changes in \nreproduction number over the coming weeks and months may help guide decisions to continue \nsocial restrictions and to monitor the impact of gradually relaxing such restrictions.  \n \nMany COVID -19 cases, particularly asymptomatic and mild ones, are not reported to public \nhealth departments so our calculation may underestimate the true reproduction number.  In \naddition, the number of people tested has increased greatly in recent days as testing kits have \nbecome more available.  This would be expected to increase COVID -19 diagnoses and \ntherefore the reproduction number.  It is encouraging  that we found a reduction in reproduction \nnumber despite this increase in testing.   Other limitations include the lack of United States data \non serial inte rvals , daily reproduction numbers can be highly variable and the small numbers of \ncases in some states.   \n \nAcknowledgment s \n \nThis study was supported in part by grants UL1 TR002548 and U54 MD002265 from the \nNational Institutes of Health.  \n  All rights reserved.
