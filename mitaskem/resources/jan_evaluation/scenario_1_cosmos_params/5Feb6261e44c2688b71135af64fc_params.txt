13 - Staffing decisions for hospitals can require a lead time of 2-4 weeks to prevent over-reliance on temporary workers, or shortages
14 - Oxygen has become a scarce resource during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also needs lead time
15 - Public officials have ordered oxygen imports well after there were needed to prevent shortages
