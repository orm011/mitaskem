2432/5763(42.4%) intervention arm contacts participated

740 during 8,379,749 days-at-risk (61.8/100k/week) in the control and intervention arms respectively
55,718 COVID-related absences during 3,092,515 person-school-days (1.8%)

8 - Removes the social penalty of a positive case triggering isolation in contacts.
9 - Uncertainty about whether DCT is appropriate for schools or more widely.
10 - Adherence to isolation is incomplete.

13 - Educational disadvantages.

15 - Educational disadvantages.
16 - Transmission following a contact event in secondary schools is infrequent.

17 - Individuals with positive LFD results were required to self- isolate immediately and requested to obtain a confirmatory PCR test within 2 days.
18 - Those with close contact with a case in the two days prior to symptom onset (or prior to positive test if asymptomatic) were required to self-isolate for 10 days.
19 - Participants who agreed to DCT swabbed their own anterior nose; swabs were tested by school staff using a SARS-CoV-2 antigen LFD (Orient Gene).
166 - Data collection Schools provided a list of all students and staff, including personal identifiers and demographics.
167 - For randomised schools that stopped active participation prior to providing these details, a list of students was obtained from the UK Government Department for Education (DfE).
172 - Schools reported the number of staff and students present on each school day, and numbers absent for COVID-19-related reasons and separately numbers absent for other reasons.
173 - For schools who stopped participating details, where available, were obtained from DfE records.
180 - Schools recorded each SARS-CoV-2 infection (“index case”) brought to their attention, including PCR-positive cases
184 - study PCR testing was also undertaken in consenting contacts in both study arms on day 2 and day 7 of the testing/isolation period
185 - co-primary outcomes were (i) the number COVID-19-related absences from school amongst those otherwise eligible to be in school
186 - co-primary outcomes were (ii) the extent of in-school Covid-19 transmission
191 - Secondary outcomes reported include DCT participation rates in the intervention arm
192 - the proportion of asymptomatic research PCR tests and symptomatic routine PCR tests in contacts that were positive
193 - the performance characteristics of LFD vs. PCR testing in participants in the intervention arm tested on the same day
208 - Rates of COVID-related absence were compared on an intention to treat (ITT) basis using quasi-Poisson regression
209 - incidence of symptomatic PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection between arms on an ITT basis using quasi-Poisson regression
218 - To account for incomplete participation in DCT, we present complier average causal effects (CACE) estimates for both primary outcomes
219 - uptake of LFD testing for intervention arm participants, on a per day and per participant basis
