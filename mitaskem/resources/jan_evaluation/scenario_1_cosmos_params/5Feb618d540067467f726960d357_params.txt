11 - Studies used the dose-response relationship of UV dose and survival fraction
12 - Studies varied UV dose by exposure time, number of UV fixtures, and fluence rate
4 - Studies associated increasing RH with decreasing susceptibility
43-45 Three modelling studies used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models (Table 4)
47 Noakes et al47 found that UV dose was less affected by which one of the four UV devices was active
48 Zheng et al48 found that attack rate decreased 87.8% when UVGI was modelled on a cruise ship
49 (Wells, 1936) (Table 5)
52 Dee et al52 acknowledged that the lack of effect was likely due to insufficient exposure time
53 Wheeler et al53 found that high intensity UV treatment was required to decrease transmission
