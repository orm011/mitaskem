33 - type A influenza viruses experience both antigenic shift and drift
34 - Booster doses could further reduce population susceptibility
35 - Cross immunity and/or residual immunity from vaccination or previous exposure
36 - Reported COVID-19 cases have been hospitalized at a relatively constant rate around 9%
37 - Early observations suggest that disease-blocking immunity wanes more slowly than infection-blocking immunity
