4–7 - Typically, control measures are differentially applied to various groups (compartments) of the society and decision-makers often need to refocus their intervention strategies as new infection hotspots or new virus variants emerge
8,9 - Mathematical modelling is now increasingly used to inform decision-makers
10,11 - In these models, disease progression is often described by variants of the now classical SEIR approach
12 - A key element is the probability of person-to-person disease transmission upon adequate contact, which defines the likelihood of a person’s transition from the susceptible to the exposed compartment
13–15 - This is often based on predefined values, but it can also be calculated from environmental data, using formulas of varying complexity
16–20 - Traditionally, the resulting models are then run with ordinary differential equations, which are deterministic and can provide crude estimates on how interventions may affect the outcome of the epidemic
19,20 - Differential equation driven analysis of vaccination strategies or other intervention policies is feasible and widely used
21–24 - Another strategy is provided by stochastic, agent-based models (ABMs), where agents, corresponding to individuals, move and transmit the infection among each other
