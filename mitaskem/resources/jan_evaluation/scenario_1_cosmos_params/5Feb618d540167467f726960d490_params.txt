Table 1
19 - hyperexponential growth
20 - growth of human population
1B - exponential
1C - slower than exponential
2 - dI/dt ∝ I
1 - dI ∝ Im. dt
m > 1 - I = C1(tc − t)α with α ∈ (−∞,0)
m = 1 - I = eC1+C2t (exponential)
m < 1 - I = C1 + C2(tc − t)α with α ∈ (0,∞)
α - −1/(m−1)
C1 & C2 - empirical constants
tc - time at which I or any of its derivatives reach infinity
2 - dI/1 = Im−1, I dt
Figure 3:
A - We show log-periodicity during the initial hyperexponential growth phase of the second wave in Chennai.
B - We fit the log-periodic power-law to the growth rate of daily infections (dI/dt) for the city of Chennai in India.
C - Lomb periodogram shows a distinct peak corresponding to ω = 4.25.
