311 - Short-term forecasts and model performance
312 - Beginning 8th March 2020, we produced weekly forecasts for every country with evidence
313 - of sustained transmission.
314 - As the pandemic rapidly spread across the world, the number
315 - of countries included in the weekly analysis grew from 3 in the first week (week beginning
316 - 8th March 2020), to 94 in the last week of analysis included in this study (week beginning
317 - 29th November 2020) (SI Fig. 1).
318 - Overall, the ensemble model performed well in capturing the short-term trajectory of
319 - the epidemic in each country.
320 - Across all weeks of forecast and all countries, an average 58.7% (SD 32.4%) of the observations were in the 50% credible interval (CrI) and 89.4%
321 - (SD 21.7%) of the observations were in 95% CrI (for a breakdown by country and week
322 - of forecast see SI Sec. 5.5).
323 - The MRE across all countries and all weeks was 0.4 (SD 0.4) (Fig. 3).
324 - That is, on average the model forecasts were 0
68.1%: of the weeks in the ‘likely growing’ phase 
67.1%: of weeks classified as ‘indeterminate’ phase 
96.4%: of the weeks in ‘definitely decreasing’ phase
