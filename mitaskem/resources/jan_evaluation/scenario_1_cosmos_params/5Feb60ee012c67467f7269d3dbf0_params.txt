1: Recommendations for elderly (70+) to self-isolate are removed and replaced by same recommendations as the general population.
2: Before November 1st the maximum amount of visitors to a public event was 50, which then was changed to 300, although a cap on maximum 50 participants in dancing events remained.
3: Prohibited public gatherings involving more than 8 people (shopping, restaurants, bars etc. were exempt from this rule).
4: Alcohol-sales only until 20.00, compared with 22.00 previously.

R0 = c(1 − θ)β
Re = cβs(t)
R0 = 1.5 and θ = 0.5
Half-life of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was estimated to 5 months
9 - Established a "moderate" decline of antibodies over 8 months
5 - Established the reinfection rate to be at most 25%
22 - Established the reinfection rate to be at most 25%
18 - Discussed in [18]
44% - Measured sero-prevalence of 44% in Manaus in June
25% - Quickly dropped to around 25% in October
30% - Maximum sero-prevalence in the population more likely was below 30%
14 - Swedish data from [14]
11.3% - Stockholm had 11.3% sero-prevalence in early June
9.6% - Mid October had 9.6% sero-prevalence
1: singing produces several orders of magnitude more aerosols than normal talking
16: SARS-CoV-2 is spread via aerosols
6: pre-immunity, or immunity past infection as well for that matter, is not a binary variable
4: Britton et. al.
24: estimates the pre-immunity directly from a time series of cases and available sero-prevalence information
13: Swedish Public Health Agency
