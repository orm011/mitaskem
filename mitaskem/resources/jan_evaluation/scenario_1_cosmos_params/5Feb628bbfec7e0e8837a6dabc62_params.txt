149 We assume separated mixing (h = 0.99).
152 Figure 2. Fatigue and long-term memory produce multiple epidemic peaks, which exceed the size of the initial peak in group b when uniform awareness and separated mixing leave that group with a high proportion of susceptible people following the first wave.
164 We initialize the model with separated mixing (݄ ൌ 0.99), long-term memory (ℓ ൌ 30), and fatigue (߶ ൌ 0.02); all other parameters are the same as in Figure 1.

174 prior infection as equivalent to immunity from vaccination
175 Unlike in the previous analyses
176 the pathogen is now introduced at the same prevalence in both populations simultaneously
177 to ensure that group a and b begin the post-vaccine period with similar levels of immunity
178 Group differences are driven by an infection fatality rate in group a that is twice that of group b
179 Again, we assume separated mixing (h = 0.99)
183 the tradeoff between the direct impacts of immune protection on preventing infections
184 and reduced uptake produces a nonlinear relationship between total infections and immune protection

52-55 - vulnerable populations may suffer compounding costs as they balance self-protection against significant disease risk without adequate support from a broader community that does not share their risks
5, 20, 46, 48, 56-60 - structural inequities often leave population subgroups that are vulnerable to larger, more severe outbreaks with reduced access to protective measures like health education, treatment, vaccination, and paid leave
61, 62 - many hypotheses have been introduced to explain this phenomenon (e.g., seasonal climate factors and population density) and several factors may have contributed to this pattern

431 epidemic dynamics, we incorporate waning immunity.
432 After vaccination or infection, individuals temporarily have complete protection from infection (RT).
433 At per capita rate ߱, they regain susceptibility to infection, this time with transmission and mortality-reducing immunity (i.e., ܵܶ).
434 As in the nonpharmaceutical intervention model, transmission-reducing protection scales transmission rates for susceptible and infected individuals by a constant.
435 Additionally, immunity from infection reduces disease-linked mortality by scaling factor ߞ.
436 Transmission-reducing immunity is lost at per capita rate ߶,
437 while the ortality-reducing immunity is retained over the course of the simulation,
438 reflecting how neutralizing antibody production may decay over time while cellular immune responses are more durable (76).
439 Susceptible individuals with mortality-reducing immunity alone (ܵܯ)
440 may regain transmission- reducing immunity via vaccination,
441 which occurs based on the same awareness function as vaccination of people without immune protection.
