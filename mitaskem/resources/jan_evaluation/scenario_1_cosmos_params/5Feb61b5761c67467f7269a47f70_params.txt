Writing St as 1 − φt, we have that Rt,v − Rt = ηT + (ηE − ηT )φt. R0
γ which itself has a HalfCauchy(0, 0.5) prior distribution. 
δv are given a Normal(0, 1) prior. 
The initial infected individuals for each variant have a uniform prior between 0 and 300,000. 
The weekly reporting rates ρ[t] each follow a Beta(5, 5) prior, 
and the case observation over-dispersion is given a HalfNormal(0, 10) prior on α− 1 2. 
Finally, the over-dispersion parameter ξ is given a Beta(1, 99) prior.
