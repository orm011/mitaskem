Wastewater-Based Epidemic Modelling
26 1 Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated wastewater-based surveillance, allowing public health to track the epidemic by monitoring the concentration of the genetic ﬁngerprints of SARS-CoV-2 shed in wastewater by infected individuals. Wastewater-based surveillance for COVID-19 is still in its infancy. In particular, the quantitative link between clinical cases observed through traditional surveillance and the signals from viral concentrations in wastewater is still developing and hampers interpretation of the data and actionable public-health decisions. We present a modelling framework that includes both SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level and the fate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA particles in the sewage system after faecal shedding by infected persons in the population. Using our mechanistic representation of the combined clinical/wastewater system, we per- form exploratory simulations to quantify the eﬀect of surveillance eﬀectiveness, public- health interventions and vaccination on the discordance between clinical and wastewater signals. We also apply our model to surveillance data from three Canadian cities to provide wastewater-informed estimates for the actual prevalence, the eﬀective reproduction num- ber and incidence forecasts. We ﬁnd that wastewater-based surveillance, paired with this model, can complement clinical surveillance by supporting the estimation of key epidemio- logical metrics and hence better triangulate the state of an epidemic using this alternative data source.

Wastewater-Based Epidemic Modelling
46 2 Introduction
Wastewater has been used previously for monitoring of a wide range of behavioural, socio- 48 economic and biological markers including: medical and illicit drugs [1, 2, 3]; antibiotic and antimicrobial resistance [4, 5, 6]; and industrial pollutant chemicals [7, 8]. Spatial 50 and temporal screening of the wastewater collection system or “sewershed” can provide qualitative and quantitative information on the marker of interest within the population 52 in a given sewer catchment contributing to the wastewater. The wastewater data when used as an index of disease burden can be incorporated into a clinical surveillance program 54 that is purposeful, economical and action-oriented for public health [9]. Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) has also proven to be a low-cost and non-invasive tool for the manage- 56 ment of infectious disease pathogens such as norovirus [10, 11] and poliovirus [12, 13, 14] where viral concentration in wastewater served to supplement clinical surveillance. Since 58 the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected and quantiﬁed in sewage in many locations worldwide (as of June 2021, 55 countries have pilot programs 60 for a wastewater surveillance system with 2,287 sampling sites [15]) and was employed successfully in correlating the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater to clinical cases 62 reported in the sewershed [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. In some instances of targeted surveillance, the leading wastewater signal (measured as SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration 64 in wastewater) compared to the clinical reports provided an early sign for the introduction or resurgence of COVID-19 into a community [25, 26, 27, 28] enabling rapid deployment 66 of public health response and mitigation eﬀorts. Despite numerous successes with wastewater-based surveillance during the pandemic, uti- 68 lizing wastewater surveillance data as a public-health tool for quick response remains chal- lenging for some jurisdictions, especially at the municipal level [29, 30]. A major hurdle is 70 the lack of a quantitative framework to assess and interpret the wastewater data generated and to translate that into public health action [31, 32]. The common practice is to use the 72 detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater as a signal for COVID-19 (re)introduction in a community and/or perform trend analysis in parallel with clinical surveillance of COVID- 74 19. At the time of this manuscript, it is generally not recommended to use SARS-CoV-2 WBS for direct inference of key epidemiological indicators such as prevalence of active 76 infections [31, 32, 16, 33]. Public health response guided by SARS-CoV-2 levels in wastewater is currently hindered 78 by a lack of structured interpretive criteria, which is at present obscured by the inherent complexity and variation imparted by diverse sewersheds and their contributing popula- 80 tions [34, 35, 36]. Sources of data variability includes individual’s shedding dynamics, sam- pling frequency of wastewater, non-standardized laboratory methods, sewershed-speciﬁc 82 viral degradation and signal attenuation during its journey from the site of faecal shedding (and potentially from urinary or sputum deposit [37, 38]) to the sampling point. Attenu- 84 ation of RNA signal in wastewater involves several factors, such as dilution in municipal

Wastewater-Based Epidemic Modelling
wastewater constituents (e.g., storm water eﬀects in combined sewers and inﬁltration ef- 86 fects in both combined and separated sewers), RNA degradation (e.g., due to household detergents and industrial wastewaters) and viral degeneration in the harsh wastewater en- 88 vironment due to temperature, bioactive chemicals, pH, etc. Solids sedimentation and resuspension may also play a key role in the transportation and decay of SARS-CoV-2 90 RNA because of the hydrophobic characteristics of the viral envelope and its strong asso- ciations to solids [39, 33]. In addition, concentration methods for detection enhancement 92 and minimization of inhibitory substances of molecular tests can result in some loss of the viral target [40, 41]. 94 Here, we present a modelling framework that attempts to link quantiﬁed SARS-CoV-2 levels in wastewater with estimates of infections in the population within the sewershed, 96 and to support policy decisions. The model incorporates both the viral transmission within the population via a standard epidemiological SEIR-like model (“Susceptible - Exposed - 98 Infectious - Recovered”) [42] and the fate of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater using a simpliﬁed hydrological transport framework. To illustrate potential applications, we ﬁt our model to 100 WBS data and traditional clinical reports gathered from six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in three Canadian cities (Edmonton, Ottawa and Toronto) and provide 102 wastewater-informed estimates of key epidemiological metrics. We also perform exploratory simulations to investigate how the wastewater signal can be mechanistically associated with 104 clinical surveillance of COVID-19.
3 Methods
106 We develop a mathematical model that mechanistically describes both the transmission at the population level (“above ground”) and the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater 108 as a result of faecal shedding from the infected individuals (“below ground”).
3.1 Transmission between individuals
110 To model SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the population, we use a SEIR-type epidemiolog- ical model. The disease progression of individuals is captured through several compart- 112 ments that reﬂect their epidemiological states and disease outcomes (Table 1). Individuals can be susceptible (S); exposed (infected but not yet infectious, E); symptomatically in- 114 fected who will later become hospitalized (J) or recovered without hospitalization during active COVID-19 (I); asymptomatically infected (A); hospitalized (H); those recovered 116 and no longer infectious but still shedding virus in faeces (Z); fully recovered and per- manently immune but not shedding anymore (R) and deceased (D). We ignore any mi- 118 gration movements, so at any given time the total population is constant and equal to N = S + E + J + I + A + H + Z + R + D. Infection occurs at a time-dependent trans- 120 mission rate βt between infectious (states I, J or A) and susceptible individuals (S). Once

infected, susceptible individuals enter the latent (non-infectious) state (E) for an average 122 duration of 1/ days, where no faecal shedding occurs. A proportion α of all infections are asymptomatic. A fraction h of symptomatic individuals are hospitalized (H) for an average 124 duration of 1/(cid:96) days and for those, the COVID-19-associatied mortality is δ. After their in- fectious period ends, patients enter the post-infection shedding state Z where SARS-CoV-2 126 faecal shedding still occurs for 1/η days on average. The exposed (E), infectious (A, I and J) and post-infection shedding (Z) states are modelled with a series of sub-compartments 128 in order to have their respective sojourn time gamma-distributed [43, 44, 45]. Note that in our model, we make the simplifying assumption that hospitalized patients–assumed mostly 130 bedridden and a small fraction of the shedding population–do not contribute signiﬁcantly to faecal shedding. 132 The transmission dynamics are represented by the system of diﬀerential equations 1a-1n and illustrated in Figure 1.

The daily concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is directly calculated from the total number of individuals that are actively shedding into the sewage system.

The parameters λk, λA k and λZ k represent SARS-CoV-2 faecal shedding dynamics per capita when the infected individual is in the epidemiological states I, J, A and Z respectively. Given the current lack of observational data, we used the same parameters λk for all epidemiological states (i.e., λk = λA k = λZ k). Values for the parameters λk were chosen to represent mid-range values of the diﬀerent results published (see Appendix Figure S2). Note that we assume the same reduction in faecal shedding as in respiratory shedding for asymptomatic cases (parameter ξ). The parameter ω implies that our model can only determine up to a constant the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater [14], even if the limit of detection of the assay is known. This reﬂects our current inability to quantify the various complex processes that aﬀect the concentration, from patients’ shedding to the concentration measured in laboratories (e.g., frequency and timing of sampling, RNA degradation in the sewer system, recovery eﬃciency of assays).

3.2.2 RNA transport and sampled viral concentration
164 We use a simple advection-dispersion-decay model to simulate the fate of SARS-CoV-2 along its journey in wastewater from the shedding points to the sampling site. This model 166 is a combination of an exponential viral decay [46] and a τ -day dispersed plug-ﬂow function, g(τ ), representing all possible hydrodynamic processes (e.g., dilution, sedimentation and 168 resuspension) that leads to RNA degradation as well as decrease and delay of signal at the time of sampling. The dispersed plug-ﬂow g(τ ) acts as a transformation function, which 170 reshapes the initial deposited concentration, W ∗, into a delayed viral distribution over τ days as a result of the transit of SARS-CoV-2 in the sewer system. Hence, we deﬁned the 172 sampled viral concentration at time t as: (cid:90) t W ∗(t − τ ) g(τ ) e−κτ dτ, (4) Wsamp(t) = 0 where κ is the daily decay rate of SARS-CoV-2 due to the harsh, complex and bioactive 174 environment of wastewater [46]. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration entering the sewage system daily is modelled as a single hydrodynamic pulse per day and the plug-ﬂow func- 176 tion, g, is obtained by the analytical solution of the axial dispersed plug ﬂow diﬀerential equation [47]. We then re-parametrize the analytical solution with the mean delay time ¯τ 178 and its standard deviation σ into a Gaussian distribution (cid:18) (cid:19) 1√ exp − (τ − ¯τ )2 .

See the Appendix for more details on our advection-dispersion-decay model of the RNA 180 transport.
3.2.3 Wastewater reported sample 182 The sample transportation, laboratory processing time and reporting lags, introduce re- porting delays of RNA concentration in wastewater. Hence, we deﬁne the reported wastew- 184 ater concentration as
(6)
W (t) = Wsamp(t − (cid:96)ww),
where (cid:96)ww is the reporting lag between wastewater sampling and concentration report 186 after laboratory analysis. (Note that the reporting delay of the wastewater measurement is independent from the delay caused by the transport of RNA particles in the sewer system 188 as deﬁned in Equation 4).

3.3 Clinical reported cases 190 We also model surveillance data derived from laboratory conﬁrmed and clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases, acknowledging that instantaneous identiﬁcation and complete reporting 192 after initial infection is not possible. We assume that a fraction ρ of symptomatic incidence is reported with a lag of a (cid:96)clinical days from the time of infection. If i(t) is the total incidence 194 at time t, we deﬁne the number of clinical cases reported at time t as:
C(t) = ρ (1 − α) i(t − (cid:96)clinical),
3.4 Wastewater and clinical surveillance data 196 We apply our modelling framework to data sets from six wastewater sampling sites located in three Canadian cities: Edmonton (Alberta), Ottawa (Ontario) and Toronto (Ontario). 198 Sampling sites are the following municipal WWTPs (abbreviation / approximate popula- tion served): Gold Bar in Edmonton (EGB / 900,000); Robert O. Pickard Environmental 200 Centre in Ottawa (OTW / 1,000,000 [48]); Toronto Ashbridges Bay (TAB / 1,603,700 [49]); Toronto Humber (THU / 685,000 [50]); Toronto Highland Creek (THC / 533,000 [51]); and 202 Toronto North Toronto (TNT / 252,530 [52]).
3.4.1 Data collection 204 Wastewater samples were collected approximately two (Edmonton and Toronto) to seven (Ottawa) times a week. The sampling location was at the inﬂuent of the wastewater 206 treatment plant of each city. Wastewater samples were collected before de-gritting in Toronto, and after for Edmonton and Ottawa.

208 Wastewater samples from Edmonton and Toronto were shipped to the National Micro- biology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration was 210 measured. RNA from wastewater samples was puriﬁed using two methods. Prior to Febru- ary 12th 2021, 15 mL of clariﬁed supernatant (after 4000 × g centrifugation for 20 min 212 at 4◦C), was concentrated using an ultracentrifugal ﬁlter device (4000 × g for 35 min at 4◦C) (Amicon Ultra-15, 10 kDa MWCO, Millipore-Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A). Total 214 RNA was extracted from the resultant concentrate (∼200 µL) using the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA Large Volume Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QC) using the Plasma 216 External Lysis 4.0 protocol as per manufacturer instructions. After February 12th 2021, the pellet resultant from clarifying (4000g for 20 minutes at 4◦C) 30 mL of wastewater 218 was resuspended in 700 µL Qiagen Buﬀer RLT (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. To this, 200 µL of 0.5 mm zirconia-silica beads (Biospec, Bartlesville, 220 OK) were added and the sample was processed with a Bead Mill 24 Homogenizer (Fisher Scientiﬁc, Ottawa, ON) using 4 × 30s pulses at 6 m/s, then clariﬁed by centrifugation 222 (12000 × g, 3 min) and the resultant lysate used for RNA extraction using the MagNA Pure 96 instrument as described above. Viral RNA was quantiﬁed using RTq-PCR with 224 the US-CDC N1 and N2 primers. For Ottawa, daily 24-hour composite primary sludge samples, consisting of four discrete 226 samples collected at 6 hour intervals and subsequently mixed, were collected and trans- ported on ice to the University of Ottawa, where samples were analyzed within 24 hours 228 of reception. Samples were concentrated by centrifugation at 10,000g for 45 minutes and RNA was extracted from a 250 mg portion of the resulting pellet using a modiﬁed ver- 230 sion of the Qiagen RNeasy PowerMicrobiome kit [28]. Quantiﬁcation was performed using singleplex probe-based RTq-PCR for the N1 and N2 gene regions of the virus. 232 For Edmonton and Toronto, the SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater were normal- ized by the total solid suspension (TSS) measured on the day the sample was collected 234 at the treatment plant. For Ottawa, they were normalized with the concentration of the Pepper mild mottle virus measured in the sample. For all cities, the reported viral con- 236 centration used in the model (W ) was the average normalized concentration across all technical replicates for both the N1 and N2 genes. 238 We obtained clinical cases and hospital admissions (except for Toronto) for the catchment area of each of the six wastewater treatment plants. Hence, we were able to link clinical 240 and wastewater surveillances. The data sets for the three cities are plotted in Figure 2 Seroprevalence values at the city and province level were obtained from Canadian Blood 242 Services (CBS) [53].

244 3.4.2 Fit to data We use an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm [54] to ﬁt the unknown 246 or unobserved model parameters to the available data. For each ABC prior iteration, the error function is deﬁned as a weighted trajectory matching (8) ei = wC(C − Cobs)2 + wH (H − Hobs)2 + wW (W − Wobs)2 248 We use 50, 000 prior ABC iterations and retain the 100 smallest errors to generate posterior distributions (acceptance ratio 2 × 10−3). The parameters ﬁtted are the time-dependent 250 transmission rate βt, ω, the hospitalization rate h and the mean transit time ¯τ . More details about the ﬁtting procedure is given in Appendix. 252 We deﬁne three types of ﬁtting-to-data procedures. “Clinical” when wC = wH = 1 and wW = 0, to use data from clinical sources only ; “WW” when wW = 1 and wH = wC = 0, 254 to use wastewater data only; and ﬁnally “Combined” by choosing the weights wC, wH and wW such that the contribution of each error term (in Equation 8) are, on average, approx- 256 imately equal. The “Combined” ﬁtting procedure aims to have approximately the same contribution from clinical and wastewater data sources (despite the diﬀerent observation 258 frequencies).
3.4.3 Inference of unobserved epidemiological quantities 260 For a given location, once the model is ﬁtted data, we can infer unobserved quantities of epidemiological importance by generating epidemic trajectories from the posterior samples. 262 The posterior prevalence distribution (at each time point) is deﬁned by simply adding the populations from the compartments representing active infection, that is nA(cid:88) nI(cid:88) nJ(cid:88) prev(t) = E + (9) Ai + Ii + Ji + H i=1 i=1 i=1 264 The posterior cumulative incidence is obtained by summing Equation 1a until time t cuminc(t) = − t(cid:88) (10) ˙Si i=1 The ﬁtted model can also provide an estimate of the eﬀective reproduction number from 266 the diﬀerent data sources (e.g., clinical and/or wastewater) using Equation 2.

dww and deﬁned as W (t = dww) = LOD where LOD is the limit of detection of the lab- 272 oratory method. In addition, the time dclinical when COVID-19 is ﬁrst reported is deﬁned as C(t = dclinical) = 1. Finally, we deﬁne the reported detection diﬀerential ∆ = dww − dclinical. 274 As a result, the wastewater signal can be classiﬁed as a leading indicator over traditional clinical surveillance when ∆ < 0. We assess how the reported detection diﬀerential ∆ can 276 be impacted by varying model parameters that would typically diﬀer from one community- sewer system to another. We select only three combinations of parameters (among many) 278 to illustrate how ∆ can be aﬀected, and most importantly how its sign can change indi- cating its transition between a leading and lagging indicator. We consider two levels of 280 COVID-19 reporting, with ρ = 30% to reﬂect a relatively ineﬃcient clinical surveillance system in the population, and ρ = 70% that represents a more eﬃcient one.
282 3.5.2 Impact of vaccination Although the model presented here does not explicitly have a vaccination process, a mech- 284 anism using the existing framework can be implemented to mimic the main eﬀects of an infection-permissive vaccine (as this is the case for the COVID-19 vaccines currently avail- 286 able). We model a simple scenario that rolls out an infection permissive vaccine by gradu- ally decreasing the transmission rate (β) by 70% over 50 days and increasing the proportion 288 of asymptomatic infection (α) from 30% to 90%. This reﬂects the growing protection of the population from severe outcomes of COVID-19 as well as decrease in transmissions as 290 the vaccine is administered. To assess the diﬀerential impact of vaccination on clinical and wastewater observations, we consider the ratio of the level of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater 292 over the reported clinical cases, W (t)/C(t).
4 Results
294 We present our results in two sections. First, we apply our modelling framework to wastew- ater and clinical surveillance data from six sampling sites located in three Canadian cities 296 (Edmonton, Ottawa and Toronto) and infer epidemiological parameters such as prevalence, eﬀective reproduction number and incidence forecast. The second section is based on ex- 298 ploratory simulations (not ﬁtted to data of a speciﬁc location) that highlight important mechanistic aspects between clinical and wastewater surveillances.
300 4.1 Application to Canadian surveillance data In this section, we compare the inferences made on key epidemiological variables by ﬁtting 302 the model to diﬀerent data sources. Our goal is to assess the added-value of the wastewater- based data stream. Hence, in the following, we present inferences by ﬁtting the model to 304 diﬀerent data sources available (“Clinical”, “WW” and “Combined”) and comparing the outcomes.

Wastewater-Based Epidemic Modelling
306 4.1.1 Prevalence estimates
Figure 3 shows, for selected locations, the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence estimated by sampling 308 the posterior distributions ﬁtted to the various data sources “Clinical”, “WW” and “Com- bined” and the evaluation of Equation 9. The right-most panel also displays estimates of 310 cumulative incidence (Equation 10) compared to available SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence lev- els estimated from surveys by the Canadian Blood Services performed on banks of blood 312 donors in Edmonton, Ottawa and Toronto [53]. Note that our model was not ﬁtted to seroprevalence data and this comparison acts as a crude check that prevalence estimates 314 from the model are approximately consistent with other independent data sources. For all locations, as expected, wastewater-only prevalence estimates are close to the clinical-only 316 ones when the levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater mimic the COVID-19 trends in the population (Figure 2). For example, the prevalence estimated from wastewater-only and 318 clinical-only are comparable for the December 2020 wave in Edmonton and April 2021 wave in Ottawa. However, when the clinical and wastewater signals are discordant, prevalence 320 estimates can be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. For example, wastewater-based prevalence esti- mates in January 2021 for Toronto Highland Creek (THC) do not show the peak seen from 322 clinical observations. On the other hand, this January peak was captured in Toronto Ash- bridges Bay (TAB)–another part of the city–and the subsequent March-May 2021 wave in 324 Toronto Highland Creek (THC) was identiﬁed by both wastewater and clinical surveillance. Finally, we note that, because of the larger variability of SARS-CoV-2 WBS and/or their 326 lower sampling frequency as compared to daily clinical surveillance, credible intervals of our wastewater-only inferences are generally larger than the clinical-only ones (Figure 3).
328 4.1.2 Eﬀective reproduction number The eﬀective reproduction number (Rt) is a key epidemiological parameter that has gained 330 recognition and application during the COVID-19 pandemic [55, 56]. Using the same ap- proach as for prevalence estimates, we inferred Rt from epidemic trajectories generated 332 from posterior distributions ﬁtted to the three diﬀerent data sources (i.e., “Clinical”, “WW” and “Combined”) and Equation 2. For comparison, we also calculate Rt using 334 the popular R package EpiEstim (version 2.2) [57] from the reported clinical cases as a separate approach. Results shown in Figure 4 exhibit the same behaviour as for the 336 prevalence estimates, that is, mean estimates of Rt are similar when trends of clinical and wastewater surveillance are comparable. Despite being based on a diﬀerent modelling 338 framework, estimates from EpiEstim are consistent with clinical-only estimates from our model. Finally, like for prevalence inferences, Rt estimates from wastewater-only data 340 (Figure 4, blue solid line) tend to have broader uncertainty interval compared to Rt from clinical-only data.

Figure 5: Forecast examples for Edmonton (left panel), Toronto/Highland Creek (middle panel) and Ottawa (right panel). Filled points represent past data of reported clinical cases. Circles represent reported clinical cases not yet observed at the time of forecast. Colour represents the type of data the model was ﬁtted to (blue, wastewater only; red, clinical data only). Dashed coloured lines indicate the ﬁtted mean for reported cases. The thick solid line shows the 1-month-ahead mean forecast, and the shaded areas their respective 95%CrI.
342 4.1.3 Forecasts
Another key advancement in our modelling framework is to generate forecasts based on 344 clinical, hospital (if available) and wastewater data.
In Figure 5 we show three 1-month-ahead forecasting examples for Edmonton, Toronto Highland Creek and Ottawa using either wastewater data only, or clinical data only. The Edmonton example (Figure 5, left panel) shows forecasts made as of April 1st, 2021. In this case, the forecasts are relatively similar because both the clinical reports and the wastewater signals are comparable and the model ﬁts were similar using either wastewater or clinical data. The Toronto Highland Creek example forecasts as of November 30th, 2020 (Figure 5, middle panel). For this location, the wastewater signal and clinical reports are discordant from December 2020 to February 2021. During this period the wastewater concentration is low and approximately ﬂat whereas the clinical reports indicate a new wave of infections. As a result, the model ﬁtted on these two data sources interprets the epidemic diﬀerently for this period and hence provides contrasting forecasts. The forecast for Ottawa as of December 15th, 2020 (Figure 5, right panel) illustrates the case when the wastewater forecast is more accurate than the one based on clinical surveillance only. At that time, the wastewater signal in Ottawa has picked up a resurgence earlier than clinical surveillance. This resurgence is then captured by the model ﬁt and hence the wastewater-based forecast correctly projects the resurgence.

4.2 Simulations
362 In this section, we report results from simulations that provide general insights in inter- preting WBS.
364 4.2.1 Leading signal and reported detection diﬀerential We vary the LOD of the wastewater assay across a broad, but realistic, range [58] and 366 calculate ∆, the detection time diﬀerence, for each simulation for a given value of LOD and the clinical reporting rate ρ. Because SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater 368 can only be determined up to a constant in our model, the LOD values chosen here are rescaled to the parameters used to run our simulations and cannot be directly interpreted 370 as RNA copies per ml, the traditional unit for LOD. Panel A in Figure 6 shows that, depending on the LOD of the laboratory assay, the wastewater concentration of SARS- 372 CoV-2 RNA can either be a leading (∆ < 0 for assays with low LODs) or a trailing indicator of cases (re)introduction when compared to reported clinical cases. This is the 374 case whether the clinical surveillance system in the population is eﬃcient or not (coloured curves, Figure 6A). 376 We also vary the decay rate of RNA SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater within a broad realistic range [46, 59, 60], as well as the transit time of SARS-CoV-2 between the shedding and 378 sampling sites. Figure 6B shows that , here again, the relative timing of (re)introduction detection by WBS compared to clinical surveillance can be aﬀected by both the harshness 380 of the wastewater (represented by the decay rate) and the transit time of SARS-CoV-2 in the sewer system. We note, as expected, that with a fast transit time (illustrated by a 1- 382 day travel time in the left-most panel of Figure 6) the decay rate will not have a signiﬁcant impact on ∆ clinical surveillance (eﬃcient, ρ = 70%, or not, ρ = 30%), but as the transit 384 time increases to 3 days (an upper bound considering strong sediment and recirculation eﬀects) the eﬀect of RNA decay becomes more important (increasing slope for the 1-day 386 and 3-day transit times, Figure 6B).
4.2.2 Assessing public health intervention eﬀectiveness 388 The ability to use wastewater signal to detect intervention eﬀectiveness can also be explored using model simulations in order to explore if a public health intervention is more clearly 390 observable in wastewater concentration measurements or in clinical reports. To do this, we choose to model an intervention such that the transmission rate β, constant until 392 the intervention time, decreases linearly to a lower value β/3 during a period of time of Tinterv and remains constant afterwards (this aims to crudely simulate a lockdown). We 394 consider the relative diﬀerence between the observed peak and 7 days later for COVID- 19 by clinical surveillance, scl(t) = C(t + 7)/C(t) − 1 and the level of SARS-CoV-2 in 396 wastewater, sww = W (t + 7)/W (t) − 1. The more negative the slope, the clearer the

signal.
Using our baseline parameters (Table 2), we simulate an intervention that reduces the contact rate to a third of its pre-intervention value at diﬀerent time of the simulations, ranging from 20 to 90 days after the introduction of the index case. Figure 7 shows that, overall, the eﬀect of an intervention that signiﬁcantly reduces transmission yields a larger relative decrease in number of COVID-19 cases than the level of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater because the post-peak slope from clinical surveillance (scl) is consistently more negative than the one from WBS (sww). The diﬀerence is more pronounced as the change in transmission is more sudden (Tinterv small). Hence, given the observation noise typically encountered, we expect that the eﬀect of a sudden change in transmission rate would be more clearly observable from clinical surveillance than from WBS.

408 4.2.3 Diﬀerential impact of vaccination
In Figure 8 shows how W (t)/C(t), the ratio of reported wastewater concentration over reported cases, increases following vaccination with a infection-permissive vaccine. Indeed, while an infection-permissive vaccine does reduce transmission, it still allows for infections to occur (mostly asymptomatic) and in particular, faecal shedding. Hence, a smaller pro- portion of infections are reported (because most of them are asymptomatic) but faecal

The vertical axis represents the post- peak relative changes from clinical reports (scl, red lines) or wastewater (sww, blue lines).

414 shedding is less aﬀected by this reporting bias and level of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater decreases less steadily than COVID-19 surveillance. In this simulation, the approximately 416 constant ratio before the start of vaccination (Figure 8B) indicates that reports from clin- ical or wastewater data sources provide a similar picture of the epidemic for that period. 418 However, once vaccination is implemented, the increasing ratio highlights a discordance between the two data sources.
420 5 Discussion
Surveillance through detection and quantiﬁcation of targeted pathogens in wastewater has 422 been a noteworthy tool for public health across the world [61, 16, 18, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. While pathogen surveillance in wastewater is not new, the scale and urgency of scientiﬁc 424 development for WBS are witnessed during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Be- cause of the novelty of SARS-CoV-2-related WBS and the lack of quantitative tools for 426 analysis, the interpretation of levels SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and their translation into actionable public health measures is still challenging [31, 32, 16, 33]. 428 Here, we have provided a modelling framework to improve the understanding of the mech- anisms at play between the viral transmission in the population and viral concentration 430 shed in wastewater. This model can also provide estimates of key unobserved epidemiolog- ical parameters. We demonstrated the applicability of our model by ﬁtting it to data from 432 three Canadian cities and made wastewater-informed inferences of important epidemio- logical metrics (prevalence, eﬀective reproduction number and forecasted incidence). Our 434 estimates for cumulative incidence were approximately in line with seroprevalence levels from cohorts of blood donors independently observed in the three cities. 436 Importantly, we observed that estimates based on wastewater-only data usually provide a similar picture of the epidemic trajectory (Figure 3) but discordant signals can occur and 438 lead to drastically diﬀerent interpretations. This was the case, for example, in January 2021 in Toronto Highland Creek where the wastewater signal did not indicate a resurgence 440 of infections, despite the wave observed from the reported clinical cases. We believe this muted peak in wastewater signal was not caused by a laboratory issue, but rather from 442 undetermined events in this particular sewershed at that speciﬁc time that need to be further investigated. 444 Similarly, the eﬀective reproduction numbers inferred from wastewater data only are consis- tent with more traditional methods, such as using clinical reports with the popular software 446 EpiEstim (Figure 4). The fact that wastewater data can potentially act as a substitute for clinical surveillance (albeit with more uncertainty) to provide critical epidemiological 448 metrics is encouraging, although more realistically, it will likely act as a complementary data source. The ability to estimate epidemiological metrics using wastewater surveillance 450 represents a step forward in demonstrating the use of wastewater data for actionable pub-

Figure 8: Infection-permissive vaccination. Panel A shows the trajectories of reported clinical cases and SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater under a scenario using an infection-permissive vaccine (“Vaccination”), or not (“Baseline”). In the vaccination scenario, the reported clinical cases decrease more rapidly than the lavel of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater because sub-clinical infections tend to be less reported whereas faecal shedding continues. Panel B highlights this diﬀerence showing W (t)/C(t), the ratio of reported wastewater concentration over reported cases, for the baseline / no- vaccination (pink) and the vaccination (green) scenarios. The ratio is normalized to have a starting value at 1 to make it easier to quantify the increase visually. The vertical dotted line indicates when vaccination starts (at time 70).

lic health metrics, if they are available to public health in a timely manner. In addition, 452 the ability to triangulate the state of an epidemic using alternative data sources helps en- sure additional conﬁdence in the estimation of relevant parameters or forecasting. Indeed, 454 the COVID-19 pandemic has consumed public-health resources at levels that are probably not sustainable for long-term surveillance of this pathogen. However, the current wastew- 456 ater surveillance performed in many communities can probably be continued as long as necessary given its relative low cost [9]. 458 Our modelling framework provides a more principled alternative to simpler smoothing tech- niques (e.g., moving averages, polynomial interpolations) that have been used to support 460 the interpretation of WBS [28]. However, we note that less complex modelling options are possible if the focus is on speciﬁc epidemiological metrics ([62, 63]). We also note 462 recent eﬀorts to use machine learning techniques and artiﬁcial neural network that incor- porate WBS [64]. While those methods are promising, they cannot–by design–explain the 464 epidemiological mechanisms at play. Our model enables in silico experiments on the epidemic/wastewater system to identify 466 key parameters and processes that can play an important role for the epidemiological inter- pretation. We showed, using simulations, that the relative timing of the wastewater signal 468 (whether it is leading or not) compared to traditional clinical surveillance is actually inﬂu- enced by the characteristics of both systems (Figure 6). On the one hand, the laboratory 470 analysis of wastewater samples may not detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 because, for example, its limit of detection is too high, or prevalence of infection in the community is 472 very small, or the viral RNA has degraded before reaching the sampling site. Shipment time of wastewater samples can also be signiﬁcant (e.g., several days) for remote sampling 474 locations without any laboratory capacity. On the other hand, the delay in clinical cases reports is usually caused by the incubation period and the reporting time of an infection 476 by the health system (turnaround time for contact tracing and/or laboratory results of in- dividuals’ swab) or availability of testing. Some communities would typically have a longer 478 lag for clinical reporting than for wastewater surveillance [20, 22, 28, 24], while others may have the opposite (for example when a very eﬀective contact tracing system is in place 480 [65] or rapid testing is implemented). Moreover, a community may experience both situa- tions, that is a period when clinical surveillance is extremely eﬃcient at detecting cases so 482 rapidly that it leads wastewater surveillance while, at other times, it can lag (for example when incidence is high, overwhelming contact-tracing and clinical testing capacities). The 484 model presented here allows to quantify how various factors can impacts the relative timing between clinical and wastewater surveillances. 486 It can be tempting to monitor the eﬀect of public health interventions using changes in the levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater given its non-invasive nature. Indeed, WBS should 488 be less aﬀected by sampling bias than clinical surveillance (for example the latter may miss most of the subclinical infections). However, our simulations showed that wastewater

490 surveillance may be inferior to clinical surveillance to identify sharp declines in transmis- sion, as typically seen after a lockdown is implemented (Figure 7). The long period of 492 faecal shedding creates a lag in comparison to the sudden drop of incidence caused by the public health intervention, inhibiting a prompt signal in wastewater. This eﬀect is visible 494 on the Canadian data sets presented here (Figure 2). We also highlight the potential for an infection-permissive vaccine to generate discordant 496 signals between wastewater and clinical surveillances (Figure 8). Indeed, vaccination im- plies a larger proportion of asymptomatic infections which are less likely to be detected by 498 clinical surveillance, but still picked up in wastewater because of continued faecal shedding. Note that we use our model to highlight this potential eﬀect, whereas detecting it in real 500 data is probably challenging without studies purposely designed to detect this. Here, we used a mixed approach regarding the normalization of the levels of SARS-CoV- 502 2 in wastewater, with Ottawa using PMMV-normalization versus TSS-normalization for Toronto and Edmonton. It is likely that some normalization is necessary to discount the 504 variations of the total faecal mass shedded and viral degradation, but it is still not clear which normalization is the most appropriate for a given sewershed. We note that we 506 considered separately each WWTP in Toronto to provide examples of application at the sub-municipal level. 508 Our modelling approach has several weaknesses. We did not precisely model the transport and fate of SARS-CoV-2 in municipal sewer systems. The lack of data about ﬂow dynamics 510 and particles binding of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater hampered a more detailed approach. Hence, we took a simple approach to model the below-ground component and assumed the 512 ﬂow dynamic followed a low-dispersion plug ﬂow model with a plausible ﬁxed decay rate [46] and varied the mean transit time (from shedding to sampling sites) within a range of 514 possible values. As more research focuses on the fate of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, the transport module of our model can be enhanced. 516 The comparison with observed seroprevalence level must be done with caution, because we do not model seroreversion (patients who were infected but subsequently test seronegative 518 because of loss of immunity or antibodies falling to undetectable levels). Our model does not model vaccination explicitly. We made this choice to keep the ﬁrst version of our 520 model relatively simple. However, we believe that we can appropriately approximate the eﬀects of infection-permissive vaccination by reducing the transmission rate and increasing 522 the proportion of asymptomatic infections. As the proportion of vaccinated individuals increases, modelling an explicit vaccination process is necessary. We note that for the 524 Canadian cities studied here, the vaccination coverage was either null or low during the study period. 526 We model SARS-CoV-2 as a single-strain pathogen which is an oversimpliﬁcation of reality, given the numerous variants circulating in Canada since late 2020 [66]. However, it is not 528 clear how (or if) multi-variants modelling would aﬀect our results, given that the diﬀerence of viral shedding (respiratory and faecal) between variants is still not fully understood

Wastewater-Based Epidemic Modelling
[67, 68]. Because of ordinary diﬀerential equations, this model is not well adapted to either small communities or very low prevalence settings. While its epidemiological structure (Figure 1) would still be valid for such environments, a more advanced statistical modelling would be preferable to handle low incidence counts and observation uncertainty [69, 70]. A further limitation of our model is the use of a scaling coeﬃcient for the amount of SARS- CoV-2 shedded in the wastewater by the infected population (parameter ω in Equation 3). This scaling coeﬃcient embeds all the uncertainties associated with sampling strategy and laboratory analysis, such as assay recovery eﬃciency, limit of detection, and total faecal mass normalization. Most of those processes are currently poorly known for SARS-CoV-2 and, as long as more observational data is not available, will constrain modelling (note that this limitation has already been identiﬁed for polio models [14]). An ultimate goal of wastewater surveillance may be to measure all the components of the scaling coeﬃcient (here, ω) in order to estimate infection prevalence in a community directly from viral concentration readings.

To conclude, the model presented here–built upon previous similar approach for other pathogens [71, 14, 72]–is a ﬁrst step to better understand the mechanistic relationships between the COVID-19 epidemic spreading in a community and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater caused by faecal shedding of infected individuals (and poten- tially from urinary or sputum shedding). Future developments should explicitly incorporate vaccination and multiple variants/strains given the ability of new assays to detect variants from wastewater samples [73, 74, 75]. This model can be the basis of quantitative tools to support public health decision making that embraces wastewater-based epidemiology. Beyond the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, WBS coupled with the type of model pre- sented here could be leveraged and applied to other transmissible pathogens where urinary or faecal shedding occurs, such as other respiratory diseases (e.g., inﬂuenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus) and some enteric diseases (e.g., norovirus, rotavirus, shigel- losis).

Wastewater-Based Epidemic Modelling



Figure S1: Illustration of the piecewise linear function to model the transmission rate βt. The break dates b1, b2, . . . are chosen manually by visual inspection of the time series of interest, and the values β(bi) are ﬁtted with an ABC algorithm.
A-1 Fitting procedure
To ﬁt the model to the clinical and/or wastewater surveillance data, we model the transmis- sion rate, βt as a piecewise linear function. We parsimoniously choose the times b1, b2, . . . (“break times”) deﬁning each segment by visual inspection of the time series (i.e., incidence of new COVID-19 cases and/or hospitalizations for clinical surveillance; SARS-CoV-2 con- centration for wastewater surveillance). Those times should correspond to changes in the transmission dynamics. The value of the transmission rate at a break date, β(bi) is ﬁt- ted using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). We chose not to ﬁt the break times bi because the ﬁtting algorithm would require a computation time that would not be practical. See Figure S1.
902 904 906 908 910 912 914
The mean transit time ¯τ and the scaling factor ω are also ﬁtted to data. For those parame- ters, the goal is primarily to allow for uncertainty rather than infer a posterior distribution as they are essentially not identiﬁable. Finally, the hospitalization rate is also ﬁtted to the hospitalization data, when available.

Wastewater-Based Epidemic Modelling
Over the study period (from early March 2020 to June 1st, 2021), we have about a dozen 916 break times bi for each city to reﬂect the various interventions (e.g., lockdowns) or behaviour (e.g., change in contact rate when schools re-opened in September 2020). Hence, the 918 parameter space to explore by the ABC algorithm is relatively large. To avoid unpractical computational times, we deﬁned relative strong priors on all parameters, that is normal 920 distributions with a mean close to the expected value (explored manually) and a relatively broad standard deviation (corresponding approximately to a coeﬃcient of variation of 922 0.5). The normal distribution was censored to positive values. The outputs of the ﬁtting procedure for all locations are shown in supplementary ﬁle File S2.
924 A-2 Relative infectiousness In Equation 1a, the force of infection from symptomatic cases is β(cid:80)nI k=1 ψkIk. For conve- 926 nience, the ψk are chosen such that nI(cid:88) (A.1) ψk = nI . k=1 Hence, when the infectiousness proﬁle is constant (λk = 1, for k = 1, . . . , nI ), the force of 928 infection is β(cid:80)nI k=1 Ik. Using this normalization allows to keep a single baseline param- eter β. Only the relative values of the ψk aﬀect the infectiousness proﬁle. Similarly for 930 asymptomatic infections, the parameters φk are chosen such that(cid:80)nA k=1 φk = nA. We assume the infectious period for symptomatic infections is 12 days on average [91, 932 92, 85, 82] and divide this period into nI = 6 sub-compartments I1, . . . , I6 where infected individuals will stay, on average, 2 days in each of them. Note that with this representation, 934 the duration of infectiousness has an Erlang distribution [93] with shape nI (and mean 12 days). The parameter ψk represents the relative infectiousness of sub-compartment 936 Ik. We assume infectiousness, that is the probability of transmission given contact, is proportional to the log viral load measured from respiratory samples in clinical studies 938 [83, 84] and choose ˜ψ = (3, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2) and then normalize according to Equation A.1 with ˜ψk/(cid:80) ˜ψk. ψk = nI k 940 Similarly, we assume a shorter infectious period for asymptomatic infections of 10 days on average [94, 91], divided into nA = 5 sub-compartments with an average stay of 2 days 942 each.
A-3 Respiratory and faecal Viral kinetics 944 Our model explicitly accounts for the temporal proﬁle of respiratory shedding via the multi- ple sub-compartments for the infectious states (A, I and J) combined with the parameters 946 φ and ψ. Similarly, it explicitly accounts for the faecal shedding kinetics via the shedding states (A, I, J and Z) and the parameters λ.

As a ﬁrst step, we establish the basic reproduction number, R0, for the model deﬁned by 954 equations 1a-1n. To derive R0, we follow the methodology presented in [42].
Asymptomatic individuals are infectious for an average duration of 1/θ, and the ratio of their infectiousness compared to all the other infectious states (I and J) is ξ. Asymptomatic incidence is a proportion α of the overall incidence. Hence, the contribution to the basic reproduction number from the asymptomatically infected individuals is

Infectious individuals that are symptomatic and that will recover without hospitalization (I) are infectious for an average duration of 1/ν. Their proportion of the overall incidence is calculated by simply stating they are not hospitalized (1 − h) and not asymptomatic (1− α), hence the proportion is (1− h)(1− α). The contribution to the basic reproduction number from the symptomatically infected individuals that will not require hospitalization

964 is RI (A.3) 0 = β(1 − h)(1 − α)/ν For the symptomatically infected persons that will require hospitalization (J), the same 966 logic applies to the I sub-group, except that we need to take into account their relative infectiousness compared to I, which is(cid:80)nJ k=1 ψk/(cid:80)nI k=1 ψk. Note that the denominator is 968 simply nI thanks to the normalization deﬁned in Equation A.1. The subgroup in state J are hospitalized (h) and not asymptomatic (1 − α) so their contribution to the basic 970 reproduction number is (cid:80)nJ k=1 ψk RJ βh(1 − α)/µ (A.4) 0 = nI We obtain the (overall) basic reproduction number by summing the respective contributions 972 from all infectious epidemiological states (A.5) R0 = RA 0 + RI 0 + RJ 0
Finally, the eﬀective reproduction number Rt is simply deﬁned as Rt = St N R0 which gives 974 Equation 2 in the main text.
A-5 Fate and RNA transport in wastewater 976 Upon fecal deposition into the wastewater, viral RNA undergoes various hydrodynamic pro- cesses and degrades during its journey from the shedding point to the sampling site [16, 33]. 978 This degradation mainly comes from RNA dilution in municipal wastewater constitutes (e.g., hygiene products, household detergents, industrial wastewater and storm waters) 980 and RNA decay resulting from harsh wastewater environment (e.g., temperature, bioac- tive chemicals, solids, pH, etc.). As a common practice, complex hydraulic models simulate 982 the in-ﬂuid transportation of the water contaminants (endemic viruses and fecal microor- ganisms) via solving a set of physics-based diﬀerential equations describing the ﬂow and 984 transport mechanisms [98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104]. These hydrodynamical models are advection and dispersion mechanisms, which describe 986 the microorganisms’ transportation by the ﬂow velocity along the longitudinal axis and its diluting process into the surrounding ﬂuid [103]. Once a mass concentration enters 988 the stream, it gradually disperses due to many physical factors such as dissolving pro- cess, velocity proﬁle, turbulent mixing, molecular diﬀusion, etc. [105]. Moreover, sediment 990 association plays a signiﬁcant role in the transport models. Several studies indicated at- tachments of microorganisms to sediments and the impact of this associations on their 992 delayed transportation [104, 102, 100]. Due to solid mass and subsequent gravitational pull, sediment’s velocity diﬀers from the ﬂow velocity and results in solid settlement at the 994 bottom of the stream. These microorganism-attached sediments, later, re-suspend during overﬂow periods, induced by heavy rainfall and industrial discharges, and act as a reservoir

Enveloped viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, dissolve less in water and tends to attach to solids as a result of their hydrophobic envelope [39, 33], and there- fore, settlement/resuspension may play a key role in transportation of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials in wastewater.

Here, we used a simple advection-dispersion-decay model to simulate the fate of SARS- CoV-2 RNA along their journey from shedding points to the sampling site. We assumed the deposited RNA concentration in the sewage system is a one-time pulse input per day and described the transfer process by a dispersed plug-ﬂow model. As the plug concentration of viral RNA enters into the ﬂow with velocity u, it gradually disperses along the longitudinal axis (ﬂow direction) with dispersion coeﬃcient D (m2/s) within the sewage pathway. The length from the shedding location to the sampling site is L. The total RNA mass arrives at the sampling point gradually over time, such that the daily pulse input concentration is delayed. Assuming a small deviation from plug ﬂow (D/uL ≤ 0.01), we can use the analytical solution of the 1-dimensional axial dispersed plug ﬂow diﬀerential equation [47, 105] as a transfer function for viral RNA in wastewater. For low diﬀusion limit, the transfer function is approximately symmetrical and deﬁned by a Gaussian distribution g(τ ), which represents the fraction of the deposited concentration at the sampling site τ days after its

The function βt is modelled as piecewise-linear. As a result, Rt from Eq. 2 is also a piecewise linear function. We interpolated Rt with a polynomial curve (by smooth spline function in R) for Figure 4. For validity purpose, we compared the interpolated and the piecewise linear function Rt and checked the smoothed and actual curves are similar. See Figure S5.
