ABSTRACT ARTICLE HISTORY Received 6 December 2020 COVID-19  outbreaks  in  China  in  late  December  2019,  then  in  the  United  States  (US)  in  early Accepted 26 May 2021 2020. In the initial wave of diffusion, the virus respectively took 14 and 33 days to spread across the provinces/states in the Chinese mainland and the coterminous US, during which there are KEYWORDS 43%  and  70%  zero  entries  in  the  space-time  series  for  China  and  US  respectively,  indicating COVID-19; contagion a zero-inflated count process. A logistic growth curve as a function of the number of days since diffusion; hierarchical the first case appeared in each of these countries accurately portrays the national aggregate diffusion; moran eigenvector spatial-time filtering; random per capita rates of infection for both. This paper presents two space-time model specifications, effects one based upon the generalized linear mixed model, and the other upon Moran eigenvector space-time filtering, to describe the spread of COVID-19 in the initial 19 and 58 days across the Chinese mainland and the coterminous US, respectively. Results from these case studies show both models shed new light on the role of spatial structures in COVID-19 diffusion, models that can forecast new cases in subsequent days. A principal  finding is  that describing the spatio- temporal diffusion of COVID-19 benefits from including a hierarchical structural component to supplement the commonly employed contagion component.
1. Introduction
Since  the  COVID-19  outbreaks  in  January  2020, researchers have rushed to understand the first-wave space-time  dynamic  of  the  disease,  and  to  assess  the effects of containment measurements. Classical analy- tical  and  numerical  models  in  epidemiology  were employed. Leung et al. (2020), for example, estimated the instantaneous reproduction number and the con- firmed case-fatality risk of COVID-19 in major cities and  provinces  in  China,  followed  by  employing a  Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered  (SIR)  model  to assess  the  potential  effects  of  relaxing  containment measures after the first wave of infection. Fanelli and Piazza  (2020)  used  SIR  to  conduct  a  similar  analysis across  China,  Italy,  and  France.  Both  Danon  et  al. (2020) and Peixoto et al. (2020) adopted metapopula- tion models to describe and predict the spread of the disease  from  regions  to  regions  across  England  and Wales,  and  Brazilian  states  of  São  Paulo  and  Rio  de Janeiro. Meanwhile, spatial statistical models also were applied to  understand the  disease space-time dynamics.  For  example,  Guliyev  (2020)  employed a spatial panel data model to tackle the issue of con- tagion diffusion within the context of China, identify- ing spatial effects pertaining to not only the spread of cases,  but  also  deaths  and  recoveries.  Giuliani  et  al. (2020)  developed  an  endemic-epidemic  multivariate time-series mixed-effects GLM for areal counts of the
COVID-19  cases  to  describe  and  predict  the  space- time  distribution  of  the  disease  across  Italy.  Briz- Redón and Serrano-Aroca (2020) adopted a Bayesian approach to analyze the effect of temperature on the accumulated COVID-19 cases, finding no evidence of associations  between  warmer  weather  and  reduction of cases. These state-of-the-art modeling efforts con- tributed  to  our  understanding  of  the  space-time dynamics  of  the  disease.  They  are,  however,  largely focused  on  contagion  diffusion  of  the  disease. Hierarchical  diffusion,  another  dimension  of  disease dynamics,  has  not  been  explicitly  addressed  in  these models. Spatial diffusion theory maintains that disease dif- fusion  almost  always  follows  two  proliferation  path- ways:  contagion,  spread  channeled  by  contiguous spatial  autocorrelation;  and,  hierarchical,  spread jumping  between  distant  places  channeled  by  an ordered sequence of places, frequently an urban sys- tem (Hägerstrand 1953; Gould 1969; Cliff et al. 1981; Reyes  et  al.  2013).  An  omission  of  the  hierarchical dimension  is  clearly  a  deficit,  which  presents  an opportunity  for  enhancing  the  current  modeling efforts  and  gaining  better  understanding  of  the COVID-19 space-time dynamics. Achieved improve- ment  with  this  expanded  conceptualization  can  be further  assessed  by  setting  the  modeling  context  in two  countries  comparable  in  size,  namely  China,

where early outbreaks occurred, and the United States (US), where the disease was rapidly spread across the country after its first appearance. Therefore, the objective of the paper is two-fold: (1) to present a spatial analysis of the initial spread of COVID- 19  across  the  Chinese  mainland  as  well  as  across  the coterminous  US  in  terms  of  both  contagion  and  hier- archical  diffusion;  and,  (2)  to  compare  the  modeling results  for  the  two  countries.  The  core  approach  is  to represent  the  spatio-temporal  dynamics  of  COVID-19 cases with a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM), where either Moran Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (MESF) or  Moran  Eigenvector  Spatial  Temporal  Filtering (MESTF) represents the random effects (Griffith, Chun, and  Li  2019)  included  in  a  model  specification.  This semi-parametric approach has the advantage of concep- tual clarity as spatial-temporal structural information can be directly incorporated in a GLMM without substantial alternation of the estimation algorithm. In the subsequent sections, we present details about the specifications of two GLMM models, one with MESF and another with MESTF. The methodology section also presents  model  estimation  and  workflows  as  well  as descriptions of the datasets, including the constructions of  the  hierarchical  spatial  weights  matrices  for  both China  and  the  US.  We  then  report  estimation  results for the spatio-temporal diffusions across the two respec- tive countries with two GLMM model specifications. The conclusion section discusses findings from this project as well as enumerates future research agenda items.
2. Methodology
The spatial statistical methodology of interest is twofold: (1) Generalized Linear Mixed Modeling (GLMM), which includes  a  Random  Effects  (RE)  term;  and,  (2)  Moran Eigenvector Space-Time Filtering (MESTF) coupled with a RE term. The time series part of a space-time series for each location furnishes repeated measures for estimating each  time-invariant  RE  term  in  the  two  analyses  sum- marized  in  this  paper.  For  the  Chinese  mainland,  the individual location-specific RE term values are indistin- guishable  from  their  Fixed  Effects  (FE)  term  counter- parts,  except  for  Xizang  Autonomous  Region,  whose confidence  intervals  for  both  values  include  the  other value. For the conterminous US, all 49 sets of values are indistinguishable. Consequently, especially after consid- ering arguments in Frondel and Vance (2010), RE spe- cifications were adopted for this paper.

2.1 Modeling Considerations
upon  the  auto-specified  modified  likelihood  func- tions  of  spatial  variables,  MESF  selects  a  subset  of eigenvectors  from  the  doubly  centered  Spatial Weights  Matrix  (SWM)  of  a  given  geographic landscape (partitioning or configuration) as covari- ates  in  conventional  non-spatial  regression  models to  filter  spatial  autocorrelation  out  of  regression residuals;  this  filtering  transfers  the  spatial  effects to  the  intercept  term,  and  renders  residuals  that mimic  spatially  independent  ones.  The  resulting linear  combination  of  the  statistically  significant eigenvectors  forms  an  Eigenvector  Spatial  Filter (ESF)  that  accounts  for  spatial  information  in  the model. The mathematical foundation of MESF is matrix eigen-decomposition, or spectral decomposition, of a  SWM,  which  decomposes  any  diagonalizable matrix into its  eigenvalues  and  eigenvectors. In  spatial  modeling,  an  n � n  binary  SWM  can  be represented as the sum of n  matrices, where λ1E1E  1 λj 1 þ λ2E2E  1 2 þ . . . þ λnEnE  1 n , denotes the jth eigenvalue, and Ej is the correspond- ing  n � 1  eigenvector  (Strang  2009).  Researchers found  that  the  domain  of  the  Moran  Coefficient (MC),  the  most  widely  adopted  measurement  of spatial autocorrelation, is bounded by the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the SWM, with the n eigenvectors  forming  distinct,  unique  orthogonal and  uncorrelated  map  patterns,  resulting in a  sequence  of  MC  values  (de  Jong  et  al.  1984; Tiefelsdorf  and  Boots  1995;  Griffith  1996).  An observed distribution of a spatial variable Y, there- fore, can be considered to be a function of selected eigenvectors of its SWM; i.e. Y ¼ f X; Eð Þ þ ε, where X denotes a set of covariates, E is a matrix of n � K eigenvectors, and ε denotes the random errors. The linear combination of these eigenvectors constitutes an ESF, which is the composite term accounting for residual spatial autocorrelation.  This  MESF approach,  also  referred  to  in  terms  of  Moran Eigenvector  Maps  (MEMs)  in  numerical  ecology (Legendre and Legendre 2012), has been successfully applied  in  regression  modeling  of  a  wide  range  of spatial random variables (Griffith 2002, 2004). This methodology can be extended to space-time model- ing, where eigenvectors from the space-time weights matrix account for spatio-temporal structural infor- mation,  entering  into  a  model  as  components  in either  fixed  or  random  effects specifications (Murakami and Griffith 2015). Estimating an ESF-based regression model typically involves the following steps:
Moran Eigenvector  Spatial Filtering (MESF)  is  one of the major methodological approaches to account- ing  for  spatial  structural  information  in  regression modeling  (Giuliani  et  al.  2020;  Griffith,  Chun,  and Li  2019).  Instead  of  estimating  parameters  based

When  describing  the  diffusion  of  West  Nile  Virus (WNV)  across  the  US,  Griffith  (2005)  compares  six different  spatial  statistical  model  specifications.  One cardinal  specification  is  Gaussian  in  nature  (i.e.  it applies  normal  curve  statistical  theory),  requiring a logarithmic Box-Cox transformation, which is inap- propriate for COVID-19 because of the excessive num- ber of zero cases occurring during the initial 19 days of its diffusion across the Chinese mainland studied here. A  suitable  Generalized  Linear  Model  (GLM)  for describing  WNV  diffusion  was  binomial  regression, because  the  response  variable  was  deaths  per  number of cases. In contrast, a suitable GLM here for describing COVID-19 diffusion is Poisson regression, because the response  variable  is  case  counts  divided  by  the  2010 national  census  population  counts  –  which  approxi- mate but do not exactly equal the actual 2020 popula- tion  counts  (whose  logarithmic  version  is  a  Poisson regression  offset  variable)  –  converting  the  response variable into a rate per 100,000 people, hence adjusting for size effects. Exploratory spatial data analysis reveals that  the  negative  binomial  probability  model  (as  an equivalent specification for a Poisson random variable with a gamma distributed mean to account for excess Poisson  variation)  fails  to  furnish  a  satisfactory  alter- native  for  COVID-19  cases,  most  likely  because  an excessive  number  of  zeroes  occurs  during  the  first 14  days  of  diffusion,  which  results  in  overdispersion and  hence  necessitates  quasi-likelihood  estimation  of the  parameters.  Consequently,  we  specify  a  zero- inflated Poisson probability model specification under- lying the rates random variable Y for the analysis sum- marized in this paper, which may be written as follows:
is  not  suitable  here.  Substituting  its  modified  ver- sion  devised  by  Kaiser  and  Cressie  (1997),  which can  accommodate  positive  spatial  autocorrelation, is unappealing because  of its  property that  the sum of  all  possible  probabilities  is  not  one  (a  funda- mental  axiom  of  probability  theory). As  an  alternative,  Griffith  (2005)  evaluates  a  RE specification,

where  Pr  denotes  probability,  μ  denotes  the  mean COVID-19  rate,  and  π  is  the  Bernoulli  random variable  representing  the  probability  of  an  excess zero occurring. Theoretically, this mixture formula- tion  requires  the  plausibility  that  some  locations are  ineligible  for  a  nonzero  count;  however,  this condition  technically  holds  because COVID-19  ori- ginally  did  not  appear  in  all  provinces  simulta- neously,  and  once  a  zero-cases  day  ended  for a  location,  it  could  not  become  a  non-zero-cases day.  Because  the  diffusion  of  COVID-19  displays positive  spatial  autocorrelation,  a  conventional auto-Poisson  model specification,  which can accommodate  only  negative  spatial  autocorrelation,
where μit  denotes the number of new disease cases in areal unit i (e.g. province, state) at time t, α denotes the global intercept term, βday  denotes the regression coefficient  for  the  country-wide  national  time  trend μday  [the expected value of βday  is 1;  Pesaran (2006) suggests  that  a  model  specification  should  contain this  term,  at  least  when  n  is  large]; ZiβZi  represents the  Random  Effects  (RE)  for  region  i,  which  is decomposed into two components, namely Spatially Structure  Random  Effects  (SSRE)  and  Spatially Unstructured  Random  Effects  (SURE);  LN  is  the logarithmic  operator,  Pi  is  the  population  counts Þ serves as an offset variable. for region i, and LN Pið The  RE  term  also  is  a  key  component  of  the  US IHME  model specification (IHME  COVID-19 Health  Service  Utilization  Forecasting  Team  2020), explicitly in terms of Bayesian analysis. The RE spe- cification  appears to be  the correct  one  for estimat- ing the zero-inflated Poisson regression model, once it  includes  spatial  and  temporal  information.  This RE conceptualization maintains that regression resi- duals  are  the  sum  of  two  components,  a  systematic part  that  arises  from,  for  example,  missing/omitted covariates, plus a stochastic part that arises from the independent and identically distributed (iid) regres- sion  errors  assumption.  A  standard  regression  ana- lysis cannot separate these two components because additional information is  necessary to  do  so. Calculating  a  spatial  autocorrelation  index,  such  as the  Moran  Coefficient,  for  regression  residuals brings  a  Spatial  Weights  Matrix  (SWM)  Cs  to  an analysis  as  additional  information  based  upon  areal unit  contiguity  (re  contagion  diffusion),  allowing identification  of  at  least  a  portion  of  the  latent  sys- tematic  part  as  spatial  autocorrelation  in  standard regression  residuals.  A  Bayesian  analysis,  such  as the one presented by Griffith (2005) for WNV diffu- sion,  employs  prior  distributions  for  parameters  as well  as  a  SWM  Cs  as  additional  information.  The outcome  is  a  systematic  segment  partitioned  into two  sub-segments,  namely,  a  Spatially  Structured RE  (SSRE),  which  relates  to  SWMs  and  represents

contagion  diffusion  mechanisms,  and  a  Spatially Unstructured  RE  (SURE),  which  essentially  is  geo- graphically  random  in  nature,  and  hence  void  of spatial  autocorrelation,  but  furnishes  clues  about aspatial omitted variables. A SURE term can consti- tute  a  response  variable  in  a  linear  regression  with substantive  attribute  covariates,  such  as  demo- graphic, economic, and  health features  of a population. A conventional SURE term represents not  only  aspatial  factors  that  are  in  play,  but  also overlooked disconnected geographic factors, such as hierarchical linkages (i.e. non-contiguous geographic ties)  when  a  specification  fails  to include  the frequentist  analysis hierarchical  SWM,  CH.  A achieves  this  same  SSRE-SURE  partitioning  by including  repeated  measures,  which  for  COVID-19 are  the  daily  counts  of  cases  time  series  for a  location,  coupled  with  a  SWM  Cs  as  additional information. Partitioning  a  RE  term  into  its  SSRE  and  SURE components can be achieved with Moran Eigenvector Spatial  Filtering  (MESF)  techniques  outlined  at  the beginning  of  the  section.  Standard  MESF  supplies a tool for accomplishing this partitioning with eigenvec- tors  extracted from the  doubly-centered  SWM,   �   � I   11T=n 11T=n , where n is the number Cs I   of areal units (i.e. 31 for China, and 49 for the US, here), I is the identity matrix, superscript T denotes the matrix transpose operation, and 1 is a n-by-1 vector of ones. Griffith (2012) extends MESF to space-time data, denot- ing it as MESTF. Because disease diffusion occurs very quickly, the MESTF formulation employed here utilizes the doubly-centered contemporaneous rather than the lagged  space-time  structure  matrix  specification  I   � ð Þ 11T= nTð ½I   11T=nT; where Þ IT � Cs þ CT � In subscript T denotes time and normal glyph T denotes the number of points in time (e.g. days for COVID-19), T-by-T  matrix  CT  denotes  time-series  structure  (i.e. ones  in  the  upper-  and  lower-off-diagonal  cells,  and zeroes elsewhere), and  � denotes the Kronecker pro- duct matrix operation. A subset of the eigenvectors of this space-time weights matrix captures the spatial and temporal autocorrelation in a space-time series. In order to  assess  hierarchical  effects,  eigenvectors  extracted from the doubly-centered hierarchical SWM   �   � I   11T=n 11T=n supplement those CH I   already included in a RE regression analysis from matrix   �   � I   11T=n 11T=n ,  whereas  eigenvectors Cs I   extracted from the doubly-centered  matrix � � � ð Þ Þ I   11T= nTð ½I   11T= nTð Þ IT � CH þ CT � In supplement  those  already  included  in  a  space-time regression analysis extracted from  matrix � � � ð Þ Þ I   11T= nTð ½I   11T= nTð .

2.2 Model specifications and estimations
Estimation  of  Equations  (3)  and  (4)  parameters involves sequential steps. In both cases, the first step is to estimate the national trend curve, μday, from an
  � PK PH where ð are the spatial k¼1 esikβskÞ and h¼1 eHihβHh ESF (MESF), with esik denoting the ith element of the kth eigenvector  selected  from  the  eigenvectors  of  matrix   �   � I   11T=n 11T=n Cs I   ,  eHih  denoting  the  ith element of the hth eigenvector selected from the eigen-   �   � vectors  of  matrix I   11T=n 11T=n ; CH I   PK PH the  spatial- k¼1 esitkβsk  and h¼1 eHithβHh  are temporal  ESF  (MESTF),  differentiating  between  them with  the  subscript  t,  representing  time;  β �ð Þ are  the respective  coefficients.  These  linear  combinations  of eigenvectors form the SSRE terms. Both  specifications  involve  a  national  non-linear trend  line  coupled  with  eigenvectors  and  an  aspatially structured  error.  The  national  time  trend,  denoted  by μday, describes the epidemiological curve for a country, and is constant across all n areal units for a given point in time,  t.  It  describes  the  initial  exponentially  increasing number of cases that a decline in number of cases fol- lows,  and  reflects  mitigation  impacts  implemented  to flatten it. The trajectory of this curve varies over time in a way that accounts for a portion of the temporal auto- correlation  contained  in  a  space-time  disease  diffusion dataset. In the MESF specification (Equation 3), the SSRE term is constant over time (i.e. measured in days here) for each areal unit, varying across these areal units, con- stituting  part  of  a  time-invariant  common  factor accounting for temporal autocorrelation. This variation across  areal  units  accounts  for  spatial  and  hierarchical autocorrelation,  relating  to  relevant  omitted  variables whose inclusions would account for this autocorrelation. The SURE term is constant over time for each areal unit, is  stochastic  in  nature,  varies  across  areal  units,  and relates  to  a  time-invariant  common  factor  accounting for  temporal  autocorrelation  by  omitted  variables  with no  geographic  manifestations.  Meanwhile,  the  MESTF specification  (Equation  (4))  relaxes  the  assumption  of a  time  invariant  common  factor,  allowing  space-time rather than solely spatial variation in the structure term.

aggregate  time  series  of  new  cases;  this  estimation involves  T  observations  (Ma  2020).  The  resulting T predicted values constitute a covariate for a space- time  dataset.  A  zero-inflated  Poisson  model  formu- lated with only this covariate, denoted by M-1, furn- ished  a  very  simple  and  incomplete  description  of a space-time series: � �
� �   � (5) þ LN Pið Þ þ REi; LN μit ¼ α þ βdayLN μday
which captures no geographic variation. The next step for Equation (3) is to decompose the RE term,
filters constructed from the doubly centered contem- poraneous  space-time  weights  matrices  (contagions and  hierarchical  cases).  Equation  (4)  is  denoted  as M-3, in which contagions and hierarchical structures are  assumed  to  be  time  variant.  To  model  the  situa- tions  where  some  structures  are  time  variant  and others  are  not,  ESTFs  are  treated  as  fixed  effects, resulting in the following comprehensive specification: � �
� �   � LN μit ¼ α þ βdayLN μday  ! XK XH þ þ REi esitkβsk þ eHithβHh k¼1 h¼1 Þ; þ LN Pið (6)
XK XH REi ¼ esikβsk þ eHihβHh þ SUREi k¼1 h¼1
using the space-time dataset combined with a GLMM approach.  As  a  posited  normal  random  variable,  the RE term has two parameters, its mean, which should be zero, and its variance. GLMM simultaneously esti-   �   mates  the  residual  {LN ^μit [^α þ ^βdayLNð^μdayÞ]} while  partitioning  it  into  (RE  +  ε),  where  ε  is a conventional iid error term, exploiting the repeated measures nature of a space-time series. Next, the RE term becomes a response variable in a stepwise linear regression specification, with the set of relevant eigen- vectors from doubly-centered SWMs Cs and CH  as the candidate  covariates  to  construct  the  ESF  [the  term PK PH k¼1 esikβsk þ h¼1 eHihβHh  in  Equation  (3)].  The linear regression residuals in each of the two estima- tions are the SURE. Because diffusion displays positive spatial  autocorrelation,  the  relevant  candidate  eigen- vectors  are  those  for  which  MCj/MC1  ≥  0.25,  where MCj  is the jth eigenvalue of a doubly-centered SWM, and the threshold value of 0.25 implies that autocor- relation  accounts for  at  least 5%  of  the  jth eigenvec- tor’s variance. In parallel with M-1 (Equation (5)), we denote this contagions-hierarchical diffusion model as M-2 (Equation (3)) and refer to it as a simple space- time RE specification. The space-time model expressed by Equation (4) is estimated in similar ways, with the eigenvector spatial
which is denoted as M-4 and referred to as a Moran Eigenvector Space Time Filter (MESTF)-RE model in the ensuing reporting sections; accordingly, RE ¼ SSREESTF þ SUREESTF. In order to evaluate the effects of hierarchical diffusions and the efficacy of the spatial filters, we first estimated models with the hier- archical  or  the  SURE  component  omitted.  Table  1 provides  a  reference  for  the  models  estimated  and described in this paper.
2.3 Hierarchical regional structures
Central  Place  Theory  (Lösch  1954;  Christaller  1966) presents conceptualizations articulating urban hierar- chies in  a system  of  cities.  Yeates and  Garner  (1980, 68) furnish one of the earliest meaningful comprehen- sive  urban  hierarchy  articulations  at  a  continental scale, namely, North America. They built their struc- ture  upon  work  by,  among  others,  Philbrick  (1957) and  Borchert  (1967,  1972),  who  emphasize  popula- tion,  migration,  transportation  networks/flows,  and commuting.  Neal  (2011)  documents  an  importance shift from population size to such geographic features as  transportation  networks  in  determining  the  US urban  hierarchy  during  the  last  century.  Population density and commuting flows enter as factors because the  formulation  of  almost  all  urban  area  definitions

include  them.  Furthermore,  Hansen  (1975),  among others,  emphasizes  the  importance  of  commuting fields—other  fields  also  play  a  role  (see  Phillips [1974])—when  articulating  an  urban  hierarchy.  This is  the  background  literature  supplying  a  foundation for those variables considered when establishing urban hierarchies  in  this  paper.  Clearly,  numerous  alterna- tive hierarchy articulations are possible, given the sub- jective  nature  of  the  construction  process,  implying a need to more thoroughly study this topic. Here, the included hierarchies rely heavily upon the more recent country-specific cited articles and supplemental infor- mation  reflected  in  the  cited  data  sources,  updating their national urban hierarchy predecessors. The hierarchical model for China’s level-I admin- istrative  regions  is  based  upon  a  collection  of  pub- lished  research  about  the  hierarchical  structures  of the Chinese urban system (Gu and Pang 2008; Song, Li,  and  Xiu  2008;  Xue  2008;  Leng  et  al.  2011;  Wang and  Jing  2017;  Han,  Cao,  and  Liu  2018;  Xiong  and Poston  2020).  Three  tiers  were identified.  Tier I  includes  two  direct-administered  municipalities, Beijing, the national capital, and Shanghai, the largest economic  center  in  the  country,  and  Guangdong Province,  which  has  two  of  this  country’s  four  Tier I cities, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Although the top position of Beijing and Shanghai has long been estab- lished, the rise of Guangdong to national prominence started  after  the  economic  reform  in  the  early  1980s coupled  with  establishment  of  the  Special  Economic Zones, with Shenzhen becoming the nation’s top high tech powerhouse and the largest migrant city. As the central city of the Pearl River Delta, one of the most advanced economic regions in the country, Guangzhou also has become one of the three “strong centers”  in  China’s  urban  hierarchy,  quantified  by railway  and  air  traffic  flows  (Wang  and  Jing  2017), and a Tier I city by a synthesized gravity model that takes  into  account  socioeconomic  factors  and  func- tional distances (Han, Cao, and Liu 2018). A sample of inter-regional population flows in January 2020 pub- lished  by  Baidu  also  confirms  Guangdong  as  a  top origin  and  destination  city  in  the  country  (qianxi. baidu.com). Although identification of the top tier regions was straight-forward,  choices  for  the  second-tier  regions were less clear cut. In Han’s synthesized gravity model, Nanjing,  Wuhan,  and  Chongqing  were  identified  as Tier  1  cities,  along  with  Beijing,  Shanghai,  and Guangzhou  (Han,  Cao,  and  Liu  2018).  Wang  and Jing also put Nanjing and Wuhan in the second tier, but they chose Chengdu instead of Chongqing as the center  of  southwest  China  (2017).  As  Chongqing became one of the four direct-administrated munici- palities, moving it to the second tier is reasonable. For the  northwest  part  of  the  country,  Gansu  Province, also  called  the  Hexi  (West  of  the  Yellow  River)
Corridor, connects the vast territories in northwestern China  with  the  rest  of  the  country.  Consequently, the second tier includes the following level-1 admin- istrative  regions:  Jiangsu  Province  (Nanjing),  Hebei Province (Wuhan), Chongqing, and Gansu Province. Tier 3 regions are first- or second-order neighbors of  either  Tier  1  or  Tier  2  regions.  Hunan  and Shandong  enjoy  multiple  connections  due  to  their locations relative to the Tier 1 and 2 regions. We also made the Tier 1 regions interconnected because they experience considerable lateral hierarchy interactions. Figure 1 depicts the resulting hierarchical structure of level 1 administrative regions in Chinese mainland. Paralleling the articulated China hierarchy, the US hierarchical model reflects both past North American urban hierarchy articulations and a collection of more contemporary published research about the hierarch- ical  structures  of  the  US  urban  system  (Yeates  and Garner  1980;  Dobis  et  al.  2015;  Nelson  and  Rae 2016). Five tiers were identified. Tier 1 includes only New York State, which houses world-class New York City (NYC), the largest economic center in the coun- try;  although  COVID-19  first  appear  in  the  western part of the US, NYC was the principal gateway for its entry  into  (particularly  from  Europe)  and  diffusion throughout this country. NYC emerged as the national urban  leader  around  1805,  and  has  maintained  this hierarchical position ever since.1 Tier 2 cities covering the  remaining  parts  of  the  US  are  Atlanta,  Chicago, Dallas-Ft.  Worth,  Denver,  Houston,  Los  Angeles, Miami  (because of  the  remoteness  of  south  FL), San Francisco, Washington, DC (the national capital), and Seattle; these metropolitan areas collectively place CA (reinforced  by  Riverside,  San  Jose,  and  San  Diego), CO,  DC,  FL  (reinforced  by  Jacksonville,  Orlando, and  Tampa),  GA,  IL,  TX  (reinforced  by  Austin  and San  Antonio),  and  WA  into  the  Tier  2 level. Historically,  this  hierarchical  level  populated  as  this set of cities ascended in the US urban system, displa- cing  other  cities,  such  as  Baltimore,  Boston,  and Philadelphia,  urban  places  initially  thriving  during the earlier history of this country. These three cities, together  with  Cleveland,  Indianapolis,  Kansas  City, Minneapolis,  New  Orleans,  Phoenix,  Pittsburgh, Portland,  and  St.  Louis,  jointly  insert  the  states  of AZ,  CT  (because  of  its  relative  location  to  Boston and  NYC),  IN,  KS,  LA,  MA,  MD,  MN,  MO,  OH (reinforced  by  Cincinnati  and  Columbus),  OR,  PA, and  VA  (because  of  its  relative  location  to  DC)  into Tier 3. Detroit began its urban system ascent around 1840, peaking in rank in the 1930s, and precipitously beginning its urban system descent in approximately 1980;  Detroit’s  current  population  is  approximately the same as its 1915 population, and roughly a third of its peak 1950 population. Accordingly, it places MI in Tier 4, with AL (Birmingham), AR (Little Rock), IA (Des  Moines),  MS  (Jackson),  NC  (Charlotte  and

University.  These  daily  data  begin  with  the  initial reporting of COVID-19 in Wuhan (Hubei Province) on 15 January 2020. The virus took 14 days to spread to  all  31  mainland  provinces;  expanding  this  time horizon  to  19  days  is  the  dynamic  geographic  land- scape of interest explored in this paper, through ana- lyses of both contagion and hierarchical diffusion.

This disease took 33 days to spread to all 48 coterminous states and the DC, which forms the active geographic landscape  of  interest  in  the  analysis  summarized  in this section. The contagion and hierarchical diffusion mechanisms uncovered for the US corroborate those

already  identified  for  China. Of  the  early 33-days-by -49-locations (i.e. 1,617 day-locations), 1131 have zero cases. A  second  dataset,  a  measure  of  population  size, contains  vintage  2019  annual  state  population  esti- mates – the latest ones available – retrieved from the US  Census  Bureau.9  Although  these  totals  do  not constitute the exact US population at risk, their state magnitudes should be much closer to current factual but unknown state populations than the 2010 decen- nial population counts whose use would more closely parallel the type of quantification utilized for the pre- ceding China analysis as well as by Danon et al. (2020). These population estimates indirectly build upon the 2010 decennial census counts, and directly build upon the 2018 annual estimates, adding births, subtracting deaths, and adding net migration (both international and  domestic)  since  1  July  2018.  These  population estimates enabled the calculation of cases of COVID- 19 per 100,000 people, the rates treated in this paper. A county level map portraying the geographic distri- bution  of  these  rates  appears  on  the  Johns  Hopkins U. Coronavirus Resource Center webpage.10
3. Spatio-Temporal Diffusion of COVID-19
This section summarizes the two principal analytical space-time  descriptions  of  the  initial  diffusion  of COVID-19  across  the  Chinese  mainland  and  the coterminous  US  during  the  initial  period  of  19 (through 2/3/2020) and 58 (through 4/12/2020) days, respectively.  The  first  model  is  a  frequentist  RE description, involving a time invariant spatially auto- correlated  common  factor  capturing  temporal  auto- correlation, whereas the second model is a MESTF-RE description, involving synthetic space-time covariates, augmented with a minor time invariant common fac- tor, accounting for not only contagion but also hier- archical diffusion.
3.1 Diffusion Across the Chinese Mainland
2.4.3 The Spatial Weights Matrices A  contiguity-based  SWM  and  hierarchical  SWM  were constructed  for  level-1  administrative regions in  China (provinces, autonomous regions, and direct- administered  municipalities,  excluding  Taiwan;  a  total of 31 regions) and the coterminous US (49 States, exclud- ing Hawaii and Alaska). A rook definition of adjacency was  used  for  the  binary  contiguity-based  SWMs,  Cs, while  first  order  network  connectivity  serves  as  the bases for the binary hierarchical SWMs, CH. The China Cs contains 138 ones; its CH  has 72 ones. The US has 220 ones in its Cs  and 102 ones in its CH.
The  total  the  Chinese  mainland  reported  number  of cases  for  the  time  period  is  20,388  (caveat:  on  1/21/ 2020,  Yunnan  Province  had  its  1st  and  a  single  new case, whereas on 1/22/2020 it had a new case removed (a negative one); both were set to 0); Figure 3a is a time series graphic portrayal of the increases in number of new cases per 100,000 people during this time horizon plus  many  days  beyond  it  (an  epidemiological  curve [i.e. time series plot] for China’s first 95 days). Because the  number  of  cases increases  over  time  with a  trajectory  initially  tracking  an  S-shaped  curve describing  exponential  growth,  and  overall  tracking a bell-shaped type curve, a logistic transformation of a quadratic function of the number of days since the first  case  of  COVID-19  appeared  in  the  country  is a  covariate  (i.e.  the  daily  average  rate  is  cast  as a  function  of  time,  and  entered  in  its  logarithmic form as a Poisson regression covariate) of the follow- ing form:

This is the equation describing the superimposed non- linear  trend  line  in  Figure  3a,  the  country-wide national  trend,  the  curve  governments  seek  to  bend. The  correspondence  between  Equation  (7)  and  the empirical  time  series  scatterplot  in  Figure  3a  yields a linear multiple correlation R2  of 0.47; removing the two extreme outliers (i.e. days 28 and 29) attributable to  a  definitional  change  for  case  reporting  increases this R2to 0.89. However, in the context of the space- time diffusion data, in accounts for less than 4% of the spatio-temporal variation (Table 3). The  simple  RE  zero-inflated  Poisson  probability model  fitting  exercise  first  estimates  an  RE  term together  with  an  intercept  and  a  coefficient  for  the time  covariate  number-of-days,  given  by  Equation (7),  and  then  decomposes  this  RE  term  into  a  SSRE and a SURE component. Consequently, Figure 3b por- trays  the  scatterplot  of  predicted  versus  observed values for the combination of contagion and hierarch- ical  diffusion  effects.  Figure  3b  has  the  classical V-shaped  dispersion  of  points  with  increasing  rates that characterizes a Poisson random variable: because the mean and variance are the same, deviations from the  trend  line  tend  to  increase  with  increasing  rates.   �   � Matrix I   11T=31 11T=31 has  eight, Cs I     �   � whereas matrix  I   11T=31 11T=31 has CH I   six, eigenvectors with positive spatial autocorrelation satisfying  the  condition  MCj/MC1  ≥  0.25.  Table  2 summarizes results for these two cases, revealing that a hierarchical structure eigenvector is very prominent, and  that  its  contagion  spatial  structure  component, which exhibits strong positive spatial autocorrelation (Figure  4a),  plays  a  prominent  role  in  the  RE  term. Contagion eigenvectors Es;8  and Es;4, and perhaps Es;3 in part, jointly try to compensate for omitted hierarch- ical eigenvector EH;6. Results of zero-inflated Poisson regression appearing in Table 3 confirm that the addi- tion of a hierarchical diffusion element to the analysis merely redistributes statistical explanation and facets between the SSRE and SURE terms without impacting upon  their  combined  outcome  represented  by  their
composite  RE  term  alone.  The  AICc  and  BIC  each decrease  by  a  factor  of  roughly  16  with  the  addition of a SSRE plus SURE term, confirming that autocor- relation plays an important role here. Expansion of the SSRE alone to include hierarchical in addition to spa- tial autocorrelation reduces that terms contribution by a factor of three, indicating the presence of an impor- tant hierarchical autocorrelation component. In  addition, Table  3  discloses that  this  space-time RE specification suffers from a poor RE term estimate, with  its  mean  markedly  deviating  from  zero  and  its frequency distribution noticeably differing from a bell- shaped normal curve; supplemental model diagnostic outcomes also suggest a lack of conformity to the zero- inflated Poisson specification. The hierarchical component in the MESTF model specification  does  more  than  merely  redistribute effects  within  a  limiting  composite  term  like  a  RE (Table 4, βH= 0). Rather, it augments contagion diffu- sion eigenvectors with hierarchical diffusion eigenvec- tors;  although  the  eigenvectors  within  each  of  these sets  are  orthogonal  and  uncorrelated,  they  do  not necessarily  possess  this  property  across  these  two sets. Because this spatial analysis involves a complete space-time series, with nT = 589, the number of eigen- vectors with MCj/MCmax ≥ 0.25 is substantially larger than that for the simple space-time RE model (M-2) specification: 136 for the spatial autocorrelation com- ponent,  of  which  the  stepwise  MESTF  zero-inflated

Poisson  regression  selected 34,  and 127 for  the hier- archical  autocorrelation  component,  of  which  the stepwise regression selected 31 additional vectors (i.e. a total of 65), with these selections being simultaneous. Figure 3c portrays an outcome from these regressions, demonstrating  that  the  MESTF  specification  shrinks the  prediction  dispersion  vis-à-vis  the  simple  space- time RE (M-2) specification; Table 4 corroborates this contention.  These  findings  imply  that  inclusion  of a hierarchical diffusion component in a spatial diffu- sion model shows considerable promise for bolstering scientific  understanding,  prediction,  and  forecasting of COVID-19 diffusion spread. Figure  5  portrays  selected  day  map  patterns  of  the constructed  ESTF,  which  is  a  linear  combination  of eigenvectors  selected  from  the  two  respective  space- time  weights  matrices.  This  structural  covariate  cap- tures a changing role played by the contagion and the hierarchical components, shifting from a hierarchically dominated mixture for the first day (R2  = 0.810, with one  contagion  and  six  hierarchical  eigenvectors),  to a  purely  hierarchical  component  for  the  14th  day  (R2 = 0.429, with three hierarchical eigenvectors), back to a hierarchically dominated mixture for the 19th day (R2 =  0.862,  with  two  contagions  and  four  hierarchical
eigenvectors). This specification outperforms the sim- ple space-time RE model (M-2) specification (Table 4) in rendering a description of the COVID-19 diffusion that already has taken place (i.e. a retrospective descrip- tion). Including  an additional  time-invariant  RE term essentially does little more than replace a number of the selected  eigenvectors  (i.e.  44)  with  a  common  factor description;  this  term  has  both  a  SSRE  and  a  SURE component, but accounts for less than 3% of the space- time variance through a redistribution from the ESTF term  (Table  4),  accompanied  by  noticeable  improve- ments  in  many  of  its  model  diagnostics.  Both  of  the AICc and BIC decreases corroborate this finding. Table 4 also reveals that the various specifications yield roughly the same slope coefficient for the global time  covariate.  In  addition,  the  bivariate  regression coefficients,  whose  theoretical  values  are  0  for  the intercept (α) and 1 for the slope coefficient (β), imply that  the  MESTF  zero-inflated  Poisson  specification including a hierarchical component renders the closest overall correspondence model results. Of note is that, based upon exploratory simulation experiments, zero inflation appears to induce deviations in the bivariate regression coefficients from their respective theoretical values.

In part, the specifications in this paper parallel the IHME statistical forecasting model (IHME COVID-19 Health  Service  Utilization  Forecasting  Team  2020), whose negative critiques emphasize its lack of epide- miological  content  (for  which  the  RE  term  substi- tutes).  Nevertheless,  the  specification  in  this  paper not only incorporates the SIR/SEIR conceptualization (Stehlé  et  al.  2011),  including  susceptible  (i.e.  total population), exposure (i.e. contagion and hierarchical components), and infectious (i.e. new cases) compart- ments, but also includes a mechanism for mitigation impacts,  namely  the  time-varying  national  aggregate mean describing the epidemiological curve. Social dis- tancing,  for  example,  can  alter  this  curve,  modifying parameter  estimates  of  Equation  (7)  in  order  to describe a flattened version of it. SSRE,  SURE,  and  RE  (the  sum  of  SSRE  and SURE)  model  components  represent  omitted  vari- ables.  SSRE  relates  to  contagion  and  hierarchical spatial  autocorrelation.  As  noted  previously,  con- struction  of  this  geographic  structure  builds  upon population  density,  flows  in  geographic  space,  and established  infrastructure.  The  amount  of living space  per  person  is  a  prominent  covariate  of  the simple  mixed  model  SSRE  term,  accounting  for more than  40%  of its  geographic  variance (Figure  6a).  The  ratio  of  non-agricultural  to  agricul- tural  population,  a type  of  urban-rural index, accounts  for  roughly  25%  of  the  simple  mixed model  SURE  term  (Figure  6b).  In  combination,  as a  RE  term,  the  male-to-female  ratio  supplements these  two  covariates,  increasing  the  amalgamated geographic  variance  accounted  for  by  the  linear combination  of  the  three  covariates  to  nearly  50%. The  screening  of  numerous  other  provincial  covari- ates  (e.g.  age,  health  status,  population  density;  e.g. see  Likassa  2020)  failed  to  identify  other  possible omitted  variables; this topic  merits  subsequent future research.  Because the two  MESTF-RE
components  account  for  such  a  small  proportion  of space-time  variation  in  the  number  of  new  cases, they  are  left  as  synthetic  variates  signifying  rather minor  omitted  variable  effects  in  that  specification.
3.2 Diffusion Across the Conterminous US
Paralleling the  preceding  the  Chinese  mainland  ana- lysis, this section summarizes two principal analytical space-time  descriptions  of  the  initial  diffusion  of COVID-19 across the coterminous US during its first 58  days  (i.e.  through  4/12/2020)  in  that  country.  As before,  one  is  a  simple  frequentist  RE  description, whereas  the  other  is  a  MESTF  description,  both including  a  hierarchical  diffusion  component.  The total  reported  number  of  new  cases  for  the  58-day time period is 551,563; Figure 7a is an epidemiological curve depicting the increases in number of new cases per  100,000  people  during  this  time  horizon  plus many  days  beyond  it.  Because  the  number  of  cases increases over time with a trajectory initially tracking S-shaped  exponential  growth,  immediately  followed by a decline in number of cases, a logistic expression coupled  with  a  quadratic  function  of  the  number  of days since the first case of COVID-19 appeared in the country is a covariate (i.e. the daily average rate is cast as  a  function  of  time,  and  entered  in  its  logarithmic form  as  a  Poisson  regression  covariate,  as  for  the China analysis) of the following form: � �2

between  Equation  (8)  and  the  empirical  time  series scatterplot in Figure 7a yields a linear multiple corre- lation  R2  of  0.95  (a  bivariate  regression  describing observed rates with predicted rates yields an intercept term of −0.318, and a slope coefficient of 1.001, nearly identical  to  their  respective  theoretical  counterpart values  of  0  and  1).  However,  in  the  context  of  the space-time  diffusion  data,  in  accounts  for  roughly 26% of the spatio-temporal variation (Table 6). Table 5 tabulates results for the pure contagion and contagion-hierarchical  cases,  again  revealing  that a  hierarchical  structure  eigenvector  is  most  promi- nent,  and  that  contagion  spatial  structure  displaying strong  positive  spatial  autocorrelation  (Figure  8a) plays  a  very  important  role,  in  the  US  COVID-19 diffusion  RE  term.  The  global  contagion  eigenvector Es;2  coupled  with  the  regional  contagion  eigenvector Es;4  jointly  try  to  compensate  for  the  omitted  domi- nant hierarchical eigenvector EH;2. Results of the zero- inflated Poisson regression model appearing in Table 6 once more confirm that the addition of a hierarchical
diffusion element to the analysis merely redistributes statistical  explanation  and  facets  between  the  SSRE and SURE terms without impacting upon their com- bined outcome represented by the composite RE term alone. As noted previously, the hierarchical component in the MESTF model not only redistribute effects within a limiting composite term (Table 7, βH  = 0), but also augments  contagion  diffusion  eigenvectors  with  hier- archical  diffusion  eigenvectors.  With  nT  =  2,842,  the number of eigenvectors meeting the initial criteria MCj /MCmax ≥ 0.25 is 652 for the contagion autocorrelation component, with 84 contiguity eigenvectors selected by stepwise regression as being important, and 674 for the hierarchical autocorrelation component, with 87 hier- archical  eigenvectors  identified  as  being  important, resulting  in  a  total  of  171  eigenvectors.  Both  Poisson regressions require quasi-likelihood estimation (Table 7 reports  the  scaling  factors).  Figure  7c  shows  that  the MESTF model that includes both a hierarchical compo- nent and a RE term once again shrinks the prediction

dispersion as compared to the simple RE (M-2) speci- fication. The SSRE component contains only two hier- archical eigenvectors that account for a trivial amount of space-time variation in the number of new cases (as expected,  given  that  the  ESTF  should  account  for  all contagion and hierarchical spatial autocorrelation); the RE  represents  little  spatial  structure  (Figure  8c;  it accounts for a mere 18% of the RE variation, which is quite small), and accounts for only a trace amount of space-time variation (Table 7). Coupled with the dra- matic AICc and BIC decreases, these findings imply, as their  counterparts  do  for  China,  that  inclusion  of a  hierarchical  diffusion  component  improves  model
diagnostics,  inferences,  and  predictions;  hierarchical autocorrelation matters. As Table 7 shows that the slopes for the global time covariate,  ^βday,  are  roughly  the  same  across  different models, which  is a similar finding  to  that for  China. Furthermore,  the  bivariate  regression  coefficients,  ^β, once again indicate that the MESTF specification ren- ders  the  best  model  fit.  As  noted  previously,  zero inflation appears to induce deviations in the bivariate regression coefficients from their respective theoretical values. Figure 9 portrays selected day map patterns of the ESTF.  As  the  virus  diffusion  progressed,  the  roles played by the contagion and the hierarchical compo- nents changed,  shifting from  a mixture  of  contagion and hierarchical pathways for the first day (R2 = 0.973, with two contagion and five hierarchical eigenvector), to  pure  hierarchical  structure  for  the  29th  day  (R2  = 0.359,  with four  hierarchical  eigenvectors), to a mixture of dominant spatial and hierarchical struc- ture for the 58th day (R2  = 0.841, with four spatial and two hierarchical eigenvector). Although this specifica- tion  only  slightly  outperforms  the  simple  space-time RE  specification  (Table  7),  with  the  inclusion  of  an additional time-invariant RE term composed of a very weak  SSRE  and  a  stronger  SURE  component  barely enhancing model fit, by accounting for less than 3% of the  space-time  variance,  the  almost  identical  results for both the China and US case studies allow a more refined  understanding  about  the  role  of  hierarchical structure in  the  diffusion  of  COVID-19  across a geographic landscape.

Finally,  because  the  SSRE  and  SURE  model  com- ponents  represent  omitted  variables,  exploration  of potential  epidemiological  factors  using  the  simple space-time RE specification reveal some of the possible missing covariates. The 2018 percentage of population at least 85-years-of-age coupled with the 2019 number of deaths from influenza per 100,000 people correlate with  the  SSRE  term,  which  relates  to  contagion  and hierarchical autocorrelation, accounting about a fifth of  its  geographic  variance  (Figure  10a).  The  2019 number of deaths from influenza per 100,000 people coupled with the logarithm of the percentage of 2019 national income generated by the retail sector of the US economy, a type of ubiquitous urban population-at -risk exposure and size index, accounts for more than 10%  of the  simple  mixed  model  SURE term (Figure 10b). Interestingly, only the logarithm of the percentage of 2019 national income generated by the retail sector of the US economy correlates with their linear combination, the RE term, suggesting that the other covariates are either masked in its aggregate or superfluous;  again,  future  research  needs  to  address this interpretation and meaning of RE terms issue. The screening  of  numerous  other  state-level  covariates (e.g.  temperature,  number  of  days  from  the  appear- ance  of  the  first  US  case  to  a  shelter-in-place  order, percentage urban population) failed to identify other possible omitted variables. As is the case for the China
analysis,  because  the  two  MESTF-RE  components account  for  such  a  small  proportion  of  space-time variation in the number of new cases, they are left as synthetic  variates  signifying  rather  minor  omitted variable effects in that specification.
3.3 A Comparative Summary
An  important  objective  for  conducting  scientific research is replicability: when addressing a particular scientific  question,  a  need  exists  to  find  consistent empirical  results  traversing  different  case  studies, each  of  which  has  its  own  dataset.  This  situation transcends generalizability of findings, and is reminis- cent of the age-old geography question about whether or not locations are unique, a question whose contem- porary answer entails mutually shared attributes and relationships across locations as well as sense-of-place type  attributes  and  relationships  somewhat  exclusive to each location. Each of the two preceding COVID-19 spread  analyses,  one  for  China  and  one  for  the  US, offers  evidence  concerning  replicability  of  the  other COVID-19  spread  investigation  summarized  in  this paper.  This  section  provides  a  comparison  of  these two case studies. The two preceding nationwide analyses share var- ious commonalities. The national trend lines for both China and the US (Figures 3a and 7a) are quadratic in

nature,  and  confirm  that  both  a  contagion  and a hierarchical diffusion pathway operate in each coun- try  without  acknowledging  where  new  cases  occur, and without compensating for them as omitted vari- ables when model M-1 is extended to models M-2 and M-4;  the  hierarchical  element  is  unmistakable,  and should  not  be  ignored  in  models  of  disease  spread (most  publications  cited  in  the  literature  review  of this paper overlook it). The most suitable probability model description for both countries is a zero-inflated Poisson specification that accounts for the presence of positive  spatial  and  temporal  autocorrelation,  with a rather stable estimate of roughly 1%-2% excess zer- oes; however, this percentage of zeroes is so small that a  zero-inflated  specification  may  not  be  warranted. The MESTF (M-4) specification outperforms the sim- ple  space-time  RE  (M-2)  specification  based  upon a  suite  of  distinct  metrics,  in  part  because  the  con- structed  ESTF  relaxes  the  inflexibility  of  the  time- invariant  space-time  RE  term  by  capturing  spatial autocorrelation  fluctuations  over  time.  Nevertheless, the SSRE-SURE decomposition of the simple RE term reflects  approximately  the  same  degree  of  positive spatial  autocorrelation  (as  indexed  by  the  MC)  for both countries. Clues furnished by each of these com- ponents  allowed  successful  identification  of  substan- tive epidemiological-relevant covariates to statistically explain  a  portion  of  them  for  both  countries;  these covariates  constitute  potential  omitted  variables. Furthermore,  an  additional  RE  term  for  the  MESTF specification is trivial but significant for each country, with its inclusion improving a number of diagnostics (e.g.  the  deviance  statistic).  Finally,  the  MESTF-RE (M-4) hybrid specification accounts for approximately 95% or more of the space-time variation in new case rates both for China and for the US. A  comparison  of  the  two  preceding  analyses  also uncovers an assortment of differentiators. Foremost is
the number of days required for the spread of COVID- 19 to all provinces/states in each country (e.g. 14 days for  China,  and  33  days  for  the  US),  somewhat  of a  surprise  given  that  the  two  territories  are  roughly equal in area extent; similarly, the aggregate number of reported new cases (by the 19th day, China had 20,388, whereas  the  US  had  111,  recorded;  by  the  58th  day, these recorded numbers respectively were 80,763 and 551,563). The functional form (which would have the same identified specification as that for the US case if the  initial  China  time  series  comprised  considerably more than 19 days) as well as the role of the national trend line  vary between these  two countries:  China’s epidemiological curve [Equation (7), Figure 3a] is only exponential  in  form,  whereas  the  one  for  the  US [Equation  (8),  Figure  7a]  has  an  additional  non- exponential quadratic term; and, the percent of space- time  variance  accounted  for  by  the  China  trend  line (model  M-1)  is  scarcely  4%  (Table  3),  whereas  it exceeds 25% (Table 6) for the US. The simple space- time  RE  model  (M-2)  specification  decompositions yield essentially a 50 - 50 split for China, but roughly a 2/3-1/3 split for the US (see the values of SSRE and RE  for  the  contagion  plus  hierarchical  diffusion model,  Tables  2  and  5).  The  15.8%  of  space-time eigenvectors  required  to  construct  an  ESTF  for  the US is conspicuously less than the 41.4% required for the China analysis, although weighting by the differ- ence  in  numbers  of  areal-unit-days  increases  it  to a  conspicuously  larger  76.1%.  Although  the  sets  of identified SURE-SSRE covariates for the simple space- time RE (M-2) specification reflect potentially omitted epidemiological factors, they notably differ for the two countries:  China  has  living  space  per  person  for  its SSRE component, the ratio of non-agricultural to agri- cultural population for its SURE component, and the addition of the ratio of males to females for its aggre- gate  RE  term;  the  US  has  percentage  of  2018
GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE 17
population at least 85 years old plus the 2019 rate of influenza deaths for its SSRE component, the 2019 rate of influenza deaths plus the 2019 national percentage of retail income for its SURE component, and only the 2019 national percentage of retail income for its aggre- gate  RE  term.  Finally,  after  accounting  for  approxi- mately  97%  of  the  space-time variance  in  new  cases, the  remaining  overdispersion  (i.e.  extra-Poisson  var- iation) for the US M-4 model is more than seven times that for the China M-4 model. In summary,  evidence exists  supporting  the repli- cation of primary findings about the spatial diffusion of COVID-19 across a national geographic landscape, one that also is nuanced and partially idiosyncratic in terms of individual locations.
4. Short-Term Forecasting
The preceding results describe new cases for the initial disease waves across two countries. However, the exis- tence of disease diffusion motivates ongoing compila- tions―released  daily  tabulations  of  new  cases  for many  subsequent  days  immediately  following  those used  to  complete  these  preceding  spatial  analyses— which  furnish  a  predictive  testbed  type  of  environ- ment  for  the  two  spatial  statistical  model  specifica- tions. Because the respective time horizons cover the periods  during  which  COVID-19  spread  across  the Chinese mainland and the coterminous US, forecasts based upon them entail only in situ expansion of the virus in each country’s population. Griffith and Chun (2014),  and Griffith  and Paelinck (2009),  furnish the methodological  foundation  for  this  section;  their approaches  aim  to  protect  against  outlier  forecasts (Cheng and Yang 2015). The tactic involves forecast- ing the total national number of new cases with a first- order autoregressive time series model. Next, each of these  forecasted  sums  is  divided  by  the  sum  of  its corresponding  forecasted  spatial  series  total,  with each  of  the  forecasted  spatial  series  then  multiplied by its respective resulting weight (Table 8); this com- putational adjustment ensures that the total forecasted number  of,  here,  predicted  new  cases  is  consistent with  the  total  number  of  observed  new  cases. Meanwhile, Tan and Chen (2020) posit an important perspective  characterizing  this  section  of  this  paper: forecasting  the  geographic  spread  of  a  disease  gov- erned by contagious and hierarchical pathways is ana- logous to weather forecasting in that only short-term forecasts  tend  to  be  reasonably  accurate  because a  plethora  of  space-time  varying  interacting  factors coupled with socio-economic/demographic and beha- vioral uncertainties operate in a dynamic geographic landscape.  Accordingly,  this  section  presents  only about a week of forecasts. Models  M-2  and  M-4  generate  the  best  forecasts, and  hence  are  the  focus  of  this  section.  The  most

advantageous traits of the M-2 model are its simplicity and parsimony. The single most advantageous benefit of the M-4 model is its best overall diagnostics, parti- cularly efficiency attributable to a better accounting of variability and a better linear alignment between fitted and observed values.
4.1 China Mainland Provincial Level Forecasts
Producing  eight  days  of  forecasts  avoids  the  two anomalous  days  in  the  China  mainland  dataset. Hubei Province (which houses Wuhan, the epicenter of  COVID-19)  is  a  blatant  outlier  (see  Figure  11)  in this  forecasting  exercise.  In  order  to  exemplify  its impact upon forecast assessment, Table 8 reports fore- casting results with and without Hubei province. Not surprisingly,  forecast  goodness-of-fit  results  improve when the dataset contains Hubei Province. Figures 11a and 11c highlight this situation, resembling the fitting of a straight line to only two points. Figure 11b as well as the bivariate regression results appearing in Table 8 imply that the simple space-time RE  model  (M-2)  specification  renders  sounder  fore- casts than the MESTF-RE (M-4) specification (e.g. its bivariate  regression  slope  coefficients  are  closer  to one); Figure 11d suggests that a one-step MESTF-RE forecast is good, but most of this model’s other fore- casts  appear  to  suffer  from  a  lack  of  inertia  buildup [i.e.  too  few  initial  time  periods,  which  Hanke  and Wichern  (2013)  argue  should  be  at  least  50,  rather than  merely  19].  The  simple  space-time  RE  (M-2) specification  scatterplots  display  good  performance regardless  of  the  inclusion  of  Hubei  Province;  the MESTF-RE  (M-4)  specification  furnishes  an  inferior performance,  with  useless  forecasts  after  two-steps ahead. The simple space-time RE (M-2) specification

without  Hubei  Province  also  suggests  that  the  rate forecasts  deteriorate  with  the  passing  of  time,  an expectation alluded to by forecasts from the MESTF- RE  (M-4)  specification.  Nevertheless,  both  specifica- tions  stress  the  important  diffusion  role  played  by a geographic hierarchy pathway.
(Figures 12a and 12c). This smaller dispersion also char- acterizes the selected best single day results (Figures 12b and 12d).
4.2 US State Level Forecasts
Producing  eight  days  of  US  forecasts  furnishes a  benchmark  for  evaluating  the  preceding  China COVID-19 diffusion results. The US time horizon is much longer, permitting an accumulation of inertia to occur  in  its  geographic  landscape,  as  is  reflected  in Table 9 tabulations, which summarize results for this case. Again, the simple space-time RE (M-2) specifica- tion outperforms the MESTF-RE (M-4) specification, but  not  as  dramatically  as  in  the  China  case.  These types of differences also may signal mitigation strategy variations beyond the national trend, such as the level of  quarantine.  Both  specifications  render  respectable forecasts, as is indicated by their R2 values. As with the China analysis, a clear deterioration of forecasts over the time horizon is not apparent.

4.3 Forecast Propositions The  preceding  analyses  imply  a  number  of  salient forecast propositions. Foremost is the assertion that a prevailing geographic hierarchy (e.g., one based upon a national urban system’s spatial structure) delivers an important  conduit  for  channeling  the  diffusion  of COVID-19 across an active geographic landscape. In other words, based upon data analytic results for both the  simple  space-time  RE  (M-2)  and  the  MESTF-RE (M-4)  specifications,  hierarchical  diffusion  pathways play an influential channeling role that cannot be ignored. Meanwhile, another appropriate postulate is that the  MESTF-RE  (M-4)  specification  tends  to  supply a  superior  retrospective  description  of  the  COVID-19 diffusion,  whereas  the  simple  space-time  RE  (M-2) specification tends to supply superior prospective short- term forecasts. This contention is consistent with the IHME COVID- 19 model specification, which is built upon this type of RE foundation. In addition, it echoes the MESTF-RE predictive  failure  highlighted  by  Table  7,  and  some- what refuted by predictive results reported in Table 8. Furthermore,  Tables  7  and  8  imply  the  following hypothesis: a direct relationship exists between the length of time series constituting a space-time series and the number of future time intervals for which the MESTF-RE (M-4) specification furnishes reasonable forecasts. The time series length for China is 19, with two future reasonable forecasts, whereas  the time series length for the US is 58, with at least six future reasonable forecasts. A final prominent assertion is that: both the simple RE (M-2) and MESTF-RE (M-4) spe- cifications  need  initial  space-time  data  in  order  to

provide forecasts, currently reducing them to uninfor- mative  equations  in  the  first  days  of  the  diffusion  of a disease such as COVID-19.
Space-time  inertia  must  accumulate  in  an  active  geo- graphic landscape before forecasts with the two model specifications  become  feasible;  Hanke  and  Wichern (2013)  argue  that  at  least  50  data  collection  points  in time need to transpire. This feature reveals a simulation experiments  gap  requiring  future  research  attention: systematic  explorations  of  synthetic  populations  need to  establish  practical  assumptions  and  their  implied space-time  trajectories  for  consideration  at  the  very beginning of a disease’s diffusion. The subsequent con- ceptualization needs to incorporate, among other facets, the prevailing spatial hierarchy.
5. Conclusions
A primary finding of the research summarized in this paper is that inclusion of a hierarchical diffusion com- ponent  matters  when  predicting  spatial  diffusion spread,  at  least  of  COVID-19;  both  the  China  and the  US  case  studies  support  this  contention,  which seems  intuitive,  although  apparently  disregarded  in most contemporary COVID-19 geographic spread lit- erature. This verdict confirms a contention repeatedly found in the spatial diffusion literature. Both the simple space-time RE (M-2) and MESTF- RE (M-4) specifications furnish useful conceptualiza- tions for short-term forecasting of the magnitude and location  of  diffusion  once  a  space-time  dataset becomes  available.  In  their  present,  simplest,  and rather unsophisticated forms, these two formulations allow  short-term  (i.e.  a  few  days  to  about  a  week) forecasts of COVID-19 diffusion. Each has its advan- tages  and  disadvantages.  The  simple  space-time  RE (M-2)  specification  presents  fewer  computational challenges, gives more respectable forecasts (e.g. mod- erately good agreement with data, consistently into the future), but merely reallocates latent spatial and hier- archical structure effects from a SURE to a SSRE term.
Although  this  reallocation  may  be  irrelevant  to  pre- diction/forecasting, ignoring it distorts understanding of  the  diffusion  process.  In  contrast,  the  MESTF-RE (M-4)  specification  more  accurately  describes  the space-time data used to estimate/calibrate its forecast- ing equation, enhancing a contagion diffusion descrip- tion  with  a  supplemental  hierarchical  diffusion description,  displays  selected  preferable  properties (e.g.  its  bivariate  regression  slope  coefficient  is  close to  one;  Tables  4  and  7),  but  produces  forecasts  that deteriorate  more  rapidly  over  time,  with  more  fore- casts outside of its narrower prediction intervals (the general V-shape of these intervals reflects the Poisson random variable nature of the new cases counts). The quality of these forecasts seems on par with the pop- ular  next-five-days  meteorological  weather  forecasts offered to the general public. Furthermore, these spe- cific  forecasts  suggest  a  strategy  of  daily  updating a  disease  diffusion  model’s  estimation  in  order  to produce a continuous sequence of next-five-day fore- casts,  similar  to  weather  forecast  practices.  One important implication here is that both formulations could  be  bolstered  by  enhancing  their  respective specifications. Another salient finding is that a preponderance of zeroes in the first half of a spatial diffusion process— representing locations to which the disease has not yet diffused—may  not  necessarily  support  the  use  of a  zero-inflated  counts  model  specification  (e.g. Tables  3  and  7  report  very  small  probabilities  of  an excessive  number  of  zeroes,  once  a  specification accounts  for  space-time  autocorrelation).  An  impor- tant advantage of employing this specification is that it is  pertinent  during  the  initial  spread  of  the  disease during  which  many  locations  have  yet  to  experience the  disease,  and  as  the  relative  number  of  zeroes diminishes, resulting in their appearing less excessive as  more  locations  become  initially  contaminated  by the disease, the estimate goes to zero (whereas, exclud- ing it from the model specification forces the Poisson probability  model  to  treat  all  zeroes  as  a  Poisson

realization, rather than some as the outcome of not yet being exposed to the disease). An integration of these myriad conclusions delivers three  interesting  propositions  that  hint  at  a  future research agenda. One concerns the lead time necessary for  generating  space-time  forecasts.  Another  focuses on  the  specification  of  the  geographic  hierarchical structure  and  the  geographic  resolution  of  the  areal units.  And  the  third  consideration  has  to  do  with alternative spatial statistical model specifications. The China data analysis gives rise to concerns over data  quality  and  the  estimation  of  μday.  First,  its national  aggregate  time  series,  the  sequential  data used  to  establish  an  epidemiological  curve  for  the country, has two extreme outlier days that raise data quality questions. Results for the MESTF-RE forecasts tend to corroborate this questionable data quality con- tention (Table 8 versus Table 9 contents), although an alternative  explanation  for  this  particular  anomalous outcome  is  that  the  China  space-time  series  is  too short  to  generate  more  extended  forecasts.  Second, considering a longer time horizon with the two aber- rations  smoothed  yields  the  following  description  of its national mean rate:
� �2 4:07033 2 þ   0:00117ð12Þ ^μday ¼   1 þ e5:66503  0:24291ð12Þ � �2 4:07033 2 þ þ   0:00117ðday þ 12Þ 1 þ e5:66503  0:24291ðdayþ12Þ (9)
which has a pseudo-R2 of 0.94 with removal of the two outliers.  In other  words,  although  Equations (7)  and (9) for China contain a time shift, Equations (8) and (9)  argue  for  the  existence  of  a  common  national number of new cases time series description. The spatial weights matrices that capture the spatial autocorrelation  information  are  at  the  core  of  the MESTF models. Specification of the hierarchical struc- ture  and  adoption  of  a  specific  areal  partitioning directly  affect  the  resulting  spatial  weights  matrices. As we indicate in the methodology section, the hier- archical structures used in this paper were constructed based upon literature research coupled with necessa- rily  being parsimonious.  More  realistic and sophisti- cated  specifications  of  the  hierarchical  structures  for both countries would surely further our understand- ing  on  the  effects  of  hierarchical  diffusion.  For  con- tagion diffusion, the effects of the geographic units, or spatial  resolution,  are  another  factor  to  be  explored further.  Both  China  and  the  US  would  profit  from application of the two forecasting models at the county level. Doing so would enable an explicit integration of the  respective  national  urban  hierarchies  into  their hierarchical  diffusion  components.  A  fundamental drawback of this effort is that the space-time dataset dimensions  would  be  approximately  2,851-by-19  for
the  China  case,  and  3,111-by-58  for  the  US  case, requiring enormous structure matrices (whose dimen- sions  are  the  square  of  this  number)  demanding numerically  intensive  computing;  as  the  preceding space-time  weights  matrices  indicate,  part  of  the accompanying  computational  burden  could  be  alle- viated by exploiting the Kronecker product operator: individual  matrix  eigenfunctions,  which  are  much smaller in size, can be combined with Kronecker pro- ducts to produce the required extremely large space- time matrices. With  regard  to  spatial  statistical  model  specifica- tions,  a  spatial  panel  model  is  an  alternative  to  the GLMM approach employed in this paper (e.g. Elhorst 2014), a viewpoint that warrants some commentary. Mechanically, they are very similar techniques. Both deal with doubly subscripted terms, with one usually being time for panel data; the mixed model concep- tualizations in this paper also have a time subscript. Their most important difference is their treatment of substantive  covariates—in  this  paper,  solely  the national  trend  term—which  when  included  in  the GLMM  corresponds  to  the  panel  data  time  compo- nent.  The  mixed  model  conceptualization  posits a two-level regression: the first level is an individual regression  for  each  areal  unit,  with  the  second  level regression  statistically  explaining  variation  in  the first-level regression coefficients. The panel data ran- dom  effects  model  is  equivalent  to  this  formulation; these  models  diverge  for  the  panel  data  fixed  effects specification. Meanwhile, in order to maintain com- parability  with  a  space-time  autoregressive  formula- tion  (Cliff  et  al.  1975),  the  analysis  summarized  in this  paper  employed  a  mixed  model  conceptualiza- tion. If evidence supports a fixed effects specification —the  preceding  fixed  and  random  effects  compari- sons initialize this evaluation—future research should extend this study using a spatial panel analysis. Besides  the  spatial panel  approach,  the  introductory literature review highlights that existing relevant main- stream COVID-19 spatial analyses utilize mixed model specifications, Bayesian analysis, and space-time concep- tualizations.  Findings  summarized  in  this  paper  differ from those for these earlier publications, in part because our specification more closely resembles a spatial panel analysis  design  coupled  with  employing  MESF  and MESTF methodology in a fixed/random effects style. In doing so, we explicitly uncover a geographic hierarchical component to better understand the disease’s diffusion, and to demonstrably exploit RE terms to identify poten- tial  omitted  variables.  Our  approach  also  intentionally addresses excess zeroes. Another  valuable  prospective  to  undertake  would be  to  express  the  geographic  spread  in  probabilistic terms,  where  probabilities  are  based  upon  both a  contagion  and  a  hierarchical  configuration  of  geo- graphic space, and forecast the potential of leaps and

creeps  of a disease  across  an active  geographic land- scape.  Moreover,  once  the  initial  COVID-19  case appeared  in  Wuhan  or  WA,  respectively  identifying the most probable sequence of its spread to the rest of Chinese  mainland  and  the  coterminous  US,  once more  with  a  day-by-day  conditional  forecast  of  its next  appearance  locations  (e.g.  province  or  state), would  have  been  tremendously  beneficial  for  effec- tively reacting to the present pandemic. Finally, the  notion of Spatial Stratified Heterogeneity  (SSH;  i.e.  geographic  variance  within more  than  between  strata)  may  be  germane  to  this type of analysis (Wang, Zhang, and Fu 2016), although to date it does not seem to have been applied to the geographic  diffusion  of  diseases  in  any  meaningful way. This is a potential future research topic, too. In  conclusion,  the  diffusion  of  COVID-19  across Chinese mainland as well as the coterminous US fol- lowed  both  contagion  and  hierarchical  geographic pathways. A simple space-time RE (M-2) specification furnishes  the  best  description  of  the  space-time unfolding of this diffusion process, one that supports short-term forecasts. Many common realized features appear  in  the  diffusion  of  COVID-19  across  both national  geographic  landscapes,  confirming  the  rea- sonableness  of  its  IHME  model  description  for  the US,  and  suggesting  the  need  to  establish  such a  model  for  China.  In  addition,  as  the  exploratory analyses of the RE terms reveals, this model formula- tion should be accompanied by a search for epidemio- logically  relevant  covariates  that  describe  the  sets  of SSRE and SURE terms.
