Abstract
Understanding (cid:12)rst and second wave of covid19 Indian data along with its few selective states, we have realized a transition between two Sigmoid pattern with twice larger growth parameter and maximum values of cumulative data. As a result of those transition, time duration of second wave shrink to half of that (cid:12)rst wave with four times larger peak values. It is really interesting that the facts can be easily understood by simple algebraic expressions of Sigmoid function. After understanding the crossing zone between (cid:12)rst and second wave curves, a third wave Sigmoid pattern is guessed.
1 Introduction
Spreading of the novel coronavirus, covid19, from China to entire globe become so alarming that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a pandemic disease on 11th March 2020 [1, 2]. The data of covid infected, recovered and death are maintained by diﬀerent countries in their government based websites. Ref. [3] is citing the corresponding website for India. From 2020 to now, a huge amount of works are attempted to (cid:12)t the covid infected daily cases and cumulative data for predicting the their pattern. Few of them are cited in Refs. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], where few Refs. [18, 24] work on second wave data and third wave prediction. Most of the studies are based on SIR model [30, 31, 32] and its extensions. This framework is widely used for other countries, e.g. Ref. [33]. However, a simple logistic function description like Sigmoid function [34, 35, 36] can also be an easy-dealing tools to understand the epidemic outbreak. In our earlier works [4, 5, 6], we have used this Sigmoid function framework for predicting (cid:12)rst wave of India data. This framework is also used for understanding epidemic size of other countries, for example Refs. [35, 36, 37]. Present work is aimed to explain the existing (cid:12)rst and second wave covid19 infection data with the help of two diﬀerent Sigmoid functions and analyzing their trends, we have predicted third wave pattern. The article is organized as follows. Starting with brief formalism part of Sigmoid function,

we have discussed about the steps of generating curves in the Sec. (2). Next, in results section, we have described the (cid:12)rst and second wave curves including our third wave predicted curves. After analyzing those results, at the end we summarized our work.
2 Mathematical Framework
(1)
In this framework part, we will discuss quickly about the Sigmoid function which will be used to interpret covid 19 data. Then we will discuss about the steps, through which we proceed. The form of Sigmoid function is ) (
) ( N0e(cid:21)t ; + 1 N (t) = N0e(cid:21)t= Nm
where N0 is initial number of cases, (cid:21) is growth parameter, Nm is the maximum values, where cumulative case N (t) will be saturated. Here t represents number of days. Now, the time derivative of Sigmoid function is ( )2 dN Noe(cid:21)t + 1 ; (2) = (cid:21)N0e(cid:21)t= dt Nm which is the number of new cases per day as we see in covid 19 data. Sigmoid function shows expo- nential behaviour in low values of t but it will saturate to a maximum values (Nmax) at high values of t. When we analyze its derivative or slope, then we will get (cid:12)rst increasing and then decreasing trends after showing a peak. The peak structure of daily cases depends on three parameters Nm, N0, (cid:21). The peak time tp, when daily cases reach its highest value, can be expressed as
(3)
(4)
ln(Nm=N0) : tp = (cid:21) ( )
( ) dN (cid:21)Nm : = p dt 4
(5) Np = Nm=2 :
At t = tp daily cases and cumulative cases are respectively ( )
and
Above simple formalism can be useful to describe covid 19 data pattern. In India we found two waves whose cumulative and daily cases data patterns can expressed in terms of two consecutive Sigmoid functions and their time derivatives. From the (cid:12)rst wave of Covid 19 Indian data [3] we (cid:12)nd out the values of tp1, (dN=dt)p1 and Nm1. These values are used in Eqs. (3) and (4) to (cid:12)nd out the values of (cid:21)1 and N01. Subscript 1 is added in the notations of diﬀerent parameters to assign (cid:12)rst wave case. For India and some selective states - 1) Maharashtra (MH), 2) Kerala (KL), 3) Karnataka (KA), 4) Tamil Nadu(TN), 5) Andhrapradesh (AP), 6) West Bengal(WB), those parameters are tabulated in Table. (1). Next, when we will go for corresponding second wave data, we will not get Nm2 as it is not till (cid:12)nished and we can not see the second saturated cumulative values. However, we can see the Np2 values from data and by using Eq. (5), we can guess Nm2 by making twice of Np2. Here, subscript 2 is

added in the notations of diﬀerent parameters to assign second wave case. Another important point for cumulative data of second wave is that we will rede(cid:12)ne it by subtracting (cid:12)rst wave maximum values Nm1. It means that Eqs. (1) and (2) for second waves will be ) (

data of India. In the left and right panels of Fig. (1) represents the data points (squares and circles) and corresponding Sigmoid (cid:12)tted curves (dotted and solid lines) in (cid:12)rst and second waves respectively . We consider 3 main data points of daily and cumulative cases at t = (tp(cid:0)2=(cid:21)); tp; (tp +2=(cid:21)), within which spreading become most dominant. We have taken three diﬀerent values of (cid:21) = 0:04; 0:045 and 0:05 to (cid:12)t the three data points of (cid:12)rst wave. In another aspect, Second wave is well (cid:12)tted with one (cid:21) = 0:08. First waves is saturated in Nm1 = 107 and second waves is saturated in Nm2 = 2 (cid:2) 107 which are already seen in covid 19 data. They are implemented as important inputs to build corresponding Sigmoid curves. Next, we will generate similar graphs in Figs. (2) and (3) for 6 selective states - MH, AP, WB, TN, KL and KA.In Fig. (2) we noticed that the daily cases data of MH, AP and TN in (cid:12)rst wave are well (cid:12)tted by (time derivative of) Sigmoid function but the same for WB, KA and KL are not so well (cid:12)tted by Sigmoid function. On the other hand in second wave all those data are favouring the Sigmoid function, which can be seen in Fig. (3). In (cid:12)rst wave there was no sharp peak for few states where as peak was clearly seen during second wave almost in every states. This is most probably because of rapidly growing of daily cases in second wave which was lacking for few states in (cid:12)rst ( ) wave. dN = In (cid:12)rst wave, we (cid:12)nd the range of growth parameter (cid:21)1 = 0:03 (cid:0) 0:05 and peak value dt p1 (0:04(cid:0)0:25)(cid:2)105. The state level range of growth parameter is quite close to the range of (cid:21)1 = 0:04(cid:0) ( ) dN 0:05 for entire country. Being added of state level peak values, we (cid:12)nd (cid:25) 1 (cid:2) 105 for India. dt p1 Diﬀerent states shown peak value at diﬀerent time points tp1 which are in the range of tp1 = 5 (cid:0) 9 months. India data shows the peak value around tp1 = 6:5 months. If we analyze second wave then ( ) dN = (0:2 (cid:0) 0:67) (cid:2) 105, state level ranges are (cid:21)2 = 0:078 (cid:0) 0:1 (excluding MH (cid:21)2 = 0:05), dt p2 ) ( dN tp2 = 2:8 (cid:0) 3:5 months and India data shows at (cid:21)2 = 0:08, (cid:25) 4 (cid:2) 105, tp2 = 3:2 months. dt p2 If we compare (cid:12)rst and second wave data of India and its diﬀerent states, then we can notice their ratios as (cid:21)2=(cid:21)1 (cid:25) 2, tp2=tp1 (cid:25) 1=2, Nm2=Nm1 (cid:25) 2. Although ratio between peak values of two waves for diﬀerent states are not quite stable. As example, it is approximately 4 for India, 5 for

WB, TN and 13 for KL etc. Considering India data as collective eﬀect, we may conclude that (cid:12)rst to second wave transition was just transition of parameters (cid:21)1 ! (cid:21)2 = 2(cid:21)1, tp1 ! tp2 = tp1=2, ( ( ( ) ) ) dN dN dN ! = 4 . Nm1 ! Nm2 = 2Nm1 and dt dt dt p1 p2 p1 Now let us come to the question whether we can identify the reason for occurring second wave after the (cid:12)rst wave? Single answer of this question is really diﬃcult but mutation of virus might be considered as a dominating point. Here, we will try to understand graphically but reader should considered that quantitative message with a very (cid:13)exible way. In Fig. (4), we have drawn (cid:12)rst and second wave daily cases curves in one portrait and we can see an overlapping/crossing zone of them around February, 2021. This is also observed in data (circles) as one can notice that second wave , rising is started after Feb, 2021. We have put few selective daily cases data at tp1 (cid:0) 2 , tp1, tp1 + 2 (cid:21)1 (cid:21)1 . One can notice that our Sigmoid curves tp1 + 4 , tp1 + 6 , tp2 (cid:0) 6 , tp2 (cid:0) 4 , tp2 (cid:0) 2 , tp2, tp2 + 2 (cid:21)1 (cid:21)1 (cid:21)2 (cid:21)2 (cid:21)2 (cid:21)2 . Outside those zones, the trends of data for (cid:12)rst and second waves are well (cid:12)tted within tp1;p2 (cid:6) 2 (cid:21)1;2 points and curves are going similar although bit of diﬀerences in numerical strengths are noticed. Now, assuming mutated virus as a dominating cause of second wave, let us try to describe the data

as follows. After entering covid19 virus into India from March, 2020, (cid:12)rst wave has received its peak around Sep, 2020 and then it went down until Feb, 2021. This imported covid19 virus are started to be mutated and among the diﬀerent variant, delta virus [38] become more contagious than previous. We may consider this delta virus as a dominating reason for second wave, which is appeared to be started from Feb, 2021 and received peak around (cid:12)rst week of May, 2021. Interestingly, (cid:12)rst con(cid:12)rmed case of delta virus in India is observed around Oct, 2020, [39] which is quite earlier than Feb, 2021, from when second wave seems to grow. So it is quite interesting fact that the growing pattern of delta virus was hidden from Oct, 2020 to Feb, 2021. We can only see the decay pattern of (cid:12)rst wave curve. If we extend our second wave Sigmoid curve before Feb, 2021, then we get N0 (cid:25) 1 around Oct, 2020. Recovering this empirical point by the simple logistic function is really very interesting fact. So if we crudely assign our (cid:12)rst and second wave as the outcome of covid19 virus and mutated/delta virus spreading, then we can (cid:12)nd recognize their overlapping zone. After realizing the transition from (cid:12)rst to second wave, we can use the idea for predicting third wave. After mutation of delta virus, recently delta plus ((cid:14)+) virus is (cid:12)rst reported in India around June, 2021. It is probably 1:5 (cid:0) 2 times contagious [40, 41] than delta virus, although the fact is not very settled [42]. We already noticed that by simply changing (cid:21)1 = 0:04 and Nm1 = 1 (cid:2) 107 to (cid:21)2 = 0:08 and Nm2 = 2 (cid:2) 107, we get (cid:12)rst to second wave transition. Doubling of the growth parameter can be connected with the two times contagious of delta virus with respect to former covid19 virus. So assuming (cid:14)+ virus as two times contagious than (cid:14) virus and assigning (cid:14)+ as a dominating cause for third wave, we have drawn another Sigmoid function with (cid:21)3 = 2(cid:21)2 = 0:16

and Nm3 = 2Nm2 = 4 (cid:2) 107 in Fig. (4). We have started it from June with N0 = 1. As (cid:14) virus started to spread from Oct, 2020 but its actual growing become noticeable from Feb, 2021, similarly (cid:14)+ virus started in June, 2021 but its actual growing might be found from mid-Aug, 2021. Most fearing point is that it might go with rapidly blowing pattern. By transforming log scale to linear scale, Fig. (4) is redrawn in left panel of Fig. (5), from where reader can guess the fearing point. Including our predicted third wave curve along with the observed (cid:12)rst and second wave curves, we may present them as transitions among three Sigmoid functions, whose parameter transformation can be expressed in a single equation: (cid:21)1 (cid:25) 0:04 ! (cid:21)2 (cid:25) 0:08 ! (cid:21)3 (cid:25) 0:16

Since there are no empirical data points from where we can guess third wave parameters, so as a possible numerical range, right panel of Fig. (5) is dedicated for that. By taking Nm3 = (2; 4; 6)(cid:2)107 and (cid:21)3 = 0:12; 0:16, 6 curves are plotted and we (cid:12)nd that the peak values can be varying from 5(cid:2)105 to 23 (cid:2) 105 and peak position can be varying from Sep, 2021 to Nov, 2021.
4 Summary
In summary, present work is intended to explain the existing (cid:12)rst and second wave covid19 infection data with the help of simple logistic function, called Sigmoid function. From the data points of peak values and peak positions for daily cases of India and its selective states MH, KL, KA, TN, WB, AP,

we have found the required input parameters of the Sigmoid functions. Our results grossly indicates a transition between two Sigmoid pattern with twice larger growth parameter and maximum values of cumulative data during (cid:12)rst to second wave transition. In parallel, time duration of second wave shrink to half of that (cid:12)rst wave and peak values of daily cases becomes four times larger. From the basic properties of Sigmoid functions, those changes can be easily realized. Another interesting aspect is revealed for mutated delta virus observation. Via backward exten- sions of second wave Sigmoid curve, we can reach to the initial point (Oct, 2020), when delta virus was (cid:12)rst observed. Implementing that idea, we can consider June, 2021 as third wave initial point, since next version mutated delta plus virus is observed on that time. Assuming two times contagious nature delta plus than delta virus, we have considered third wave Sigmoid function with doubled growth parameter with respect to second wave Sigmoid functions. Including our third wave predic- tion, we have sketched three waves in terms of three Sigmoid functions. Their growth parameters and maximum values of cumulative cases are jumping two times than previous; their daily cases peak values are jumping four time; and their epidemic duration shrinks from 12 months to 6 months to 3 months.
