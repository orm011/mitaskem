Abstract
Respiratory viruses are capable of transmitting via an aerosol route. Emerging evidence suggests that  SARS-CoV-2  which  causes  COVID-19  can  be  spread  through  airborne  transmission, particularly  in  indoor  environments  with  poor  ventilation.  Heating,  ventilation,  and  air conditioning  (HVAC)  systems  can  play  a  role  in  mitigating  airborne  virus  transmission.  We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature examining the effectiveness of HVAC
design  features  in  reducing  virus  transmission—here  we  report  results  for  ultraviolet  (UV)
radiation.  Following international  standards  for  systematic  reviews,  we  conducted  a comprehensive search and synthesized findings from 32 relevant studies published between 1936 and 2020. Research demonstrates that: viruses and bacteriophages are inactivated by UV radiation; increasing UV dose is associated with decreasing survival fraction of viruses and bacteriophages; increasing relative humidity is associated with decreasing susceptibility to UV radiation; UV dose and corresponding survival fraction are affected by airflow pattern, air changes per hour, and UV device location; and UV radiation is associated with decreased transmission in both animal and
2
human studies. This comprehensive synthesis of the scientific evidence examining the impact of UV radiation on virus transmission can be used to guide implementation of systems to mitigate airborne spread and identify priorities for future research.

Ultraviolet radiation and virus transmission
Practical Implications
In-duct  ultraviolet  germicidal  irradiation  (UVGI)  addresses  virus  transmission  throughout  the
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system of a building as a whole; whereas, upper-
room UVGI addresses virus transmission in one room of that building. The susceptibility of a virus
is often determined from the relationship between UV dose and survival fraction of the virus, and
can be affected by relative humidity. Modelling studies revealed that practical implementation of
UVGI in HVAC systems should consider airflow patterns, air changes per hour, and UV device
location. Future field studies of UVGI systems could address an existing research gap and provide
important information on system performance in real-world situations.

Introduction
COVID-19, the disease caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020.1 Since then, public health authorities worldwide have sought evidence about the route of transmission and appropriate public health measures to mitigate virus spread. Certain viruses have been proven capable of transmitting via an aerosol route.2 In the case of aerosol transmission, virus-laden aerosols are expelled by humans and remain airborne for
extended  periods  of  time.  Emerging  evidence  suggests  that  the  SARS-CoV-2  virus  can  spread
through airborne transmission under certain circumstances, particularly in indoor environments with poor ventilation.3,4 Selecting appropriate measures to protect the occupants of indoor spaces based  on  informed,  interdisciplinary  research  is  critical  to  managing  the  spread  of  infectious disease.5
Heating,  ventilation,  and  air  conditioning  (HVAC)  systems  can  play  a  role  in  mitigating  the
airborne  transmission  of  viruses  by  removing  or  diluting  contaminated  air  inside  a  building enclosure  where  humans  breathe.5-7  Many  features  within  HVAC  systems  can  influence transmission,  such  as  ventilation  rates,  filters,  humidity,  and  ultraviolet  (UV)  radiation.  Under ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), a dose of UV light is delivered to the aerosolized virus which causes damage to the DNA impeding its ability to replicate. The ability for these cells to infect a host are therefore lost.8

UV radiation can be applied within mechanically ventilated spaces in the building environment
through  in-duct  or  upper-room  lamp  fixtures.  Irradiation  in  an  enclosed  space,  such  as  in-duct UVGI, allows for better control of the UV dose, resulting in better control of particle/pathogen exposure  to  UV  radiation.  Non-enclosed  systems,  such  as  upper-room  UVGI,  depend  on  air circulation to drive the particles/pathogens to an irradiated zone near the ceiling (designed to shield

unwanted exposure of skin and eyes to UV radiation) as air moves through the UV zone generally
due  to  air  currents  which  are  subject  to  room-scale  turbulence.  Importantly,  in-duct  UVGI
addresses  virus  transmission  throughout  the  building  by  treating  the  air  in  the  HVAC  system; whereas, upper-room UVGI addresses virus transmission within one room by treating the air in that room.
The use of UV radiation as a method of disinfection to help reduce the circulation and transmission
of viruses has been investigated in prior research as early as the 1940s. In a narrative review of prevention  and  control  measures  of  viral  bioaerosols,  Bing-Yuan7  cited  several  studies  that collectively  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  UV  in  protecting  humans  from  transmission  of airborne viruses.9-13 A more recent narrative review by Raeiszadeh and Adeli14 discussed the use of UV disinfection systems for both surfaces and air in the context of COVID-19, and cites one experimental study demonstrating inactivation of airborne coronaviruses by UV.15 Both of these reviews  were  not  systematic  and  do  not  provide  a  comprehensive  synthesis  of  the  scientific evidence examining UV radiation.
Even  as  late  as  2019,  the  American  Society  of  Heating,  Refrigerating,  and  Air-Conditioning Engineers  (ASHRAE),  in  their  2019  ASHRAE  Handbook,16  recognized  that  despite  improved UVGI system design guidance from significant advances in the analysis and modelling of UVGI systems by Riley et al,17 First et al,18 Kowalski,19 and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and  Health  (NIOSH),20  no  consensus  guidelines  exist  that  exhaustively  address  all  aspects  of UVGI system design.

We conducted a systematic review to examine whether virus transmission is affected by heating, ventilation,  and  air  conditioning  (HVAC)  design  features,  in  particular,  UV  radiation.  Our objective was to examine published research evaluating the effectiveness of UVGI in reducing

virus transmission. The insight drawn from this review could help answer questions of the utility
of  UVGI  as  an  adjunct  technology  to  curb  the  spread  of  the  SARS-CoV-2  in  mechanically ventilated indoor environments. Further, understanding effectiveness relative to technology set-up and UV dose could inform control measures.
Methods
This paper describes the results of a systematic review to identify and synthesize the scientific
literature examining the impact of UV radiation on virus viability and transmission within the built
environment. This was part of a larger research program to review the literature on HVAC design features and airborne virus transmission. Due to the volume and heterogeneity of research, results for other design features of interest (ventilation, filtration, and humidity) are reported separately. We  developed  an  a  priori  protocol21  that  is  publicly  available  and  the  systematic  review22  is registered.  We  followed  standards  for  the  conduct  of  systematic  reviews  defined  by  the international Cochrane organization23 with modifications for questions related to etiology.24 We report the review according to accepted reporting standards.25
Search strategy
A research librarian (GMT) searched three electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Compendex, Web of Science Core) from inception to June 2020 using concepts related to virus, transmission, and HVAC. The search strategy for Ovid MEDLINE appears in Table 1; the strategies were peer-
6
reviewed by two librarians (TL, AH) prior to implementing the searches. The search was updated
in  January  2021.  We  screened  reference  lists  of  all  relevant  papers  as  well  as  relevant  review articles. We identified conference abstracts through Compendex and Web of Science; abstracts

were not included but we searched the literature to see whether any potentially relevant abstracts
had  been  published  as  complete  papers.  We  did  not  limit  the  search  by  year  or  language  of
publication; however, we only included English-language studies due to the volume of available literature and resource constraints. References were managed in EndNote with duplicate records removed prior to screening.
Study selection
Study selection occurred in two stages. First, two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of all references identified by the electronic databases searches. Relevance of each record was classified as Yes, No or Maybe. Conflicts between Yes/Maybe and No were resolved by one reviewer. We conducted pilot testing with three sets of studies (n=199 each) to ensure consistency among  the  review  team.  After  each  set  of  pilot  screening,  the  review  team  met  to  discuss discrepancies and develop decision rules. The second stage involved two reviewers independently
reviewing the full text articles and applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Studies were classified
as Include or Exclude. Conflicts between Include and Exclude were resolved by consensus of the review team. Conflicts between different exclusion reasons were resolved by one reviewer. We pilot tested the second stage of screening with three sets of studies (n=30 each). After each pilot round, the review team met to resolve discrepancies. We conducted screening using Covidence software.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Table 2 lists our inclusion and exclusion criteria. As noted above, this systematic review was part of a larger effort to examine different HVAC design features and virus transmission. We searched and  screened  for  all  design  features  at  once,  but  only  studies  evaluating  UV  radiation  are synthesized here. While our interest was UV within HVAC systems, we also included studies of

upper room UVGI because of its similar utility and mechanism of air disinfection. We searched
for a variety of agents but prioritized studies of viruses or agents that simulated viruses; we planned to include other agents (e.g., bacteria, fungi) only if studies were not available that were specific to viruses. We included studies of bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacterial cells.19 We  were  interested  in  studies  of  the  indoor  built  environment  (e.g.,  office,  public,  residential buildings)  which  had  mechanical  ventilation.  We  included  primary  research  that  provided quantitative  results  of  the  correlation  or  association  between  installed  UV  radiation  and  virus survival  or  transmission.  We  placed  no  restrictions  on  year  of  publication;  we  included  only English-language, peer-reviewed publications.
Risk of Bias assessment
For experimental studies, we assessed risk of bias based on three key domains: selection bias, information bias and confounding.26-27 We assessed each domain as high, unclear, or low risk of bias  using  signaling  questions28  from  guidance  documents  for  the  different  study  types  we included;  e.g.,  animal  studies,  laboratory  experiments,  epidemiological  studies.26-27,29  For modelling  studies,  we  assessed  the  following  three  key  domains:  definition,  assumption,  and validation.29-30 Definition considers model complexity and data sources, assumption considers the description and explanation of model assumptions, and validation considered model validation and sensitivity analysis.30 Also, we assessed each domain as high, unclear or low risk of bias based on signaling questions.29-31 The risk of bias items were pilot tested among three review authors, then two reviewers (GMT, BAF) applied the criteria independently to each relevant study and met to resolve discrepancies.

We  extracted  general  information  about  the  study  (authors,  year  of  publication,  country  of
corresponding  author,  study  design)  and  methods  (setting,  population  [as  applicable],  agent
studied, intervention set-up). We extracted details on UV treatment parameters (where available), including: wavelength; UV dose; exposure time; and fluence rate. Also, we extracted information (where available) regarding relative humidity (RH). The studies were grouped as “in-duct UVGI” and “upper-room UVGI.” We extracted quantitative data, as well as results of any tests of statistical significance related to UV features. A priori, our primary outcome of interest  was quantitative measures of the association between UV radiation and virus transmission; however, during the review we realized that most studies focused on proxy variables such as virus survival. Therefore, we  extracted  data  on  actual  transmission  where  available  (i.e.,  infections),  as  well  as  proxy variables  (e.g.,  survival  fraction  (SF),  dose-response  of  UV  dose  and  survival  fraction,
susceptibility  (Z),  and  equivalent  air  changes  per  hour (ACH)  due to  UV  radiation  (ACHuv)).
Survival fraction (SF) is the concentration of virus after UV exposure divided by the concentration of virus before UV exposure. UV dose (D) [J/m2] is the fluence rate [W/m2] multiplied by the exposure  time  [s].  The  dose-response  relationship  of  UV  dose  and  survival  fraction  is  often represented  as  SF  =  exp(-ZD),  where  Z  is  the  susceptibility  and  exp()  represents  exponential function. Equivalent ACH due to UV radiation (ACHuv) is the number of air changes per hour (ACH)  that  would  produce  the  same  reduction  in  virus  concentration  as  obtained  using  UV radiation. We created a data extraction form spreadsheet to ensure comprehensive and consistent capture of data. One reviewer extracted data and a second reviewer verified data for accuracy and completeness. Discrepancies were discussed by the review team.

We anticipated that meta-analysis would not be possible due to heterogeneity across studies in
terms of study design, UV features examined, outcomes assessed, and reporting of results. We developed evidence tables describing the studies and their results (as reported by the authors of the primary studies). We provide a narrative synthesis of the results of relevant studies. To allow for meaningful synthesis and comparison across studies, we divided the studies into four groups: aerosolized virus, modelling, animal studies, human studies. Within the aerosolized virus group, the effect of RH was further examined.
Results
The electronic searches and other sources yielded 12,177 unique citations; 2,428 were identified as potentially relevant based on title/abstract screening and 568 met the review’s inclusion criteria (Figure 1). Of the 568, 125 were relevant to UV radiation and, of those 125, 32 were relevant to UV radiation and virus (Figure 1). Among the 32 relevant studies there were: 16 aerosolized virus and bacteriophage studies (Table 3), 7 modelling studies (Table 4), 4 animal studies (Table 5), and 5 human studies (Table 6). Studies were published between 1936 and 2020 (median year 2007.5). While the majority of the experimental and modelling studies were published between 2005 and 2020, with one exception in 1964, the human studies are all from the 1940s and the animal studies spanned from 1936 to 2020. The majority of studies were conducted in the United States (n=24).
Studies  were  funded  by  national  research  funding  organizations  (n=13),  industry  (n=6),  a
university and state grant (n=1), and hospital (n=1); 2 studies reported no external funding and 8 studies did not report funding source.

Table 3 shows that 17 viruses and five bacteriophages from 16 studies were inactivated by UV
radiation.  Generally,  susceptibility  was  determined  from  the  dose-response  relationship  of  UV dose and survival fraction11,13,15,32-34; however, Walker and Ko10 calculated susceptibility from a single dose and corresponding survival fraction, and Lin et al35 used both approaches. Some entries in Table 3  are presented as survival  fraction calculated from the reported efficiency36-38 or the reported log reduction.39 For Qiao et al39 and Pearce-Walker et al,39 a lower detection limit was used to calculate the reported efficiency and log reduction, respectively. For Verreault et al,40 the reported  relative  infectious  ratio  appears  to  be  equivalent  to  survival  fraction;  however, associations are presented with respect to relative infectious ratio. For 3 studies, UV radiation was associated with survival fraction.37-39
Increasing  UV  dose  was  associated  with  decreasing  survival  fraction  for  10  viruses  and  five bacteriophages  from  12  studies.  Increasing  UV  dose  was  associated  with  decreasing  survival fraction where the dose-response relationship was used to calculate susceptibility for seven studies (Table 3).11,13,15,32-35 Additionally, UV dose was associated with decreasing survival fraction where dose varied by exposure time,36,40 number of UV fixtures,12 and fluence rate.41-42
Increasing RH was associated with decreasing susceptibility in four studies11,13,32-33 for a variety of infectious agents including viruses (Influenza A, Vaccinia virus, PRRSV) and bacteriophages (MS2,  phiX174,  phi6,  T7)  (Figure  2).  Cutler  et  al33  reported  that  PRRSV  susceptibility  was significantly  lower  at  ≥80%RH  compared  with  25%RH-79%RH.  In  addition,  four  studies  that report  susceptibility  at  one  RH  are  included  in  Figure  210,15,34-35  where  three  viruses  were coronaviruses  (murine  hepatitis  virus  (MHV)  coronavirus,  human  coronavirus  229E,  human coronavirus  OC43).  Considering  the  findings  for  influenza  A13,34  and  coronaviruses,10,15  UV

associated  with  decreasing  survival  fraction  characterized  by  the  susceptibility.  If  enveloped,
single-stranded RNA animal viruses behave like influenza A (Figure 2), then increasing RH may be associated with decreasing susceptibility to UV radiation of coronavirus. The design of the UV radiation in an HVAC system should consider the reported coronavirus susceptibility recognizing that two are dose-response15 and one is single dose10 (Table 3).
Bacteriophage MS2 showed a discrepancy where Tseng and Li32 found that increasing RH was associated  with  decreasing  susceptibility  and  Walker  and  Ko10  found  that  increasing  RH  was associated with increasing susceptibility. Walker and Ko10 acknowledged that this relationship for bacteriophages (MS2) and animal viruses (adenovirus) was different from that reported previously for  bacteria.  Other  differences  between  the  two  studies  of  bacteriophage  MS2  include  the susceptibility  calculation  and  suspending  medium.  Susceptibility  was  calculated  using  dose- response of UV dose and survival fraction by Tseng and Li32 and using a single dose and survival faction by Walker and Ko.10 Deionized water was used by Tseng and Li32 and phosphate buffered saline with 0.01% Tween 80 and Antifoam A was used by Walker and Ko.10
Three  studies  examined  upper-room  UVGI  using  a  room-sized  chamber.12,41-42  McDevitt  et  al (2008) examined the effect of summer conditions (80% RH and fan directing air downwards) and winter conditions (40% RH and fan directing air upwards) on survival of vaccinia virus, in addition to number of fixtures and ACH for upper-room UVGI. Comparing winter and summer conditions, increasing RH and changing fan direction were associated with increasing survival fraction and decreasing  equivalent  ACH.  Overall,  increasing  RH  was  associated  with  increasing  survival fraction, decreasing susceptibility and decreasing equivalent ACH. These findings suggest that the design of UV radiation in an upper-room UVGI system should consider the typical variation of indoor relative humidity throughout the year.

Modelling studies
In  the experimental  study  by  McDevitt  et  al12  increasing  ACH  was  associated  with  increasing survival  fraction.  Two  modelling  studies  confirmed  the  association  of  increasing  ACH  and increasing survival fraction (Table 4).43-44 Increasing ACH is associated with increasing survival fraction because the increased ACH decreases the time that the infectious agent is exposed to UV radiation. Li et al43 considered the removal survival fraction which was the sum of the survival
fraction attributed to UV radiation and the survival fraction attributed to ventilation. Increasing
ACH was associated with decreasing removal survival fraction and decreasing ventilation survival fraction despite an increasing UV radiation survival fraction. The relationship between ACH and UV radiation is an important design consideration.
Susceptibility  (Z),  like  those  calculated  in  the  aerosolized  virus  studies,  are  important  input parameters in modelling studies.43-45 Three modelling studies used computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) models (Table 4) to investigate the association of UV device location and UV dose and/or survival fraction. Li et al43 found that the survival fraction was decreased when the UV devices
were located at the ceiling in the centre of the four walls compared with at the four corners. Sung and Kato45 found that the highest UV dose and lowest survival fraction were associated with the UV device being located opposite the one exhaust. Noakes et al47 found that UV dose was less affected by which one of the four UV devices was active when ventilated air was supplied at the floor and extracted at the ceiling compared with when ventilated air was supplied at the ceiling and extracted at the floor.
Furthermore, UV dose was associated with airflow pattern. Noakes et al47 found a higher average UV dose in the occupied region of the room when ventilated air was supplied at the floor and extracted at the ceiling compared with when ventilated air was supplied at the ceiling and extracted

at the floor. The modelling of upper-room UVGI confirmed that designs must consider airflow pattern,47 ACH,43-44 and UV device location.43,45,47
UV  radiation  was  associated  with  decreased  attack  rate  which  is  the  number  of  new  cases  in
population at risk divided by number of persons at risk in population. Zheng et al48 found that attack rate decreased 87.8% when UVGI was modelled on a cruise ship where the ACH due to UV was 12 ACH.
Animal and human studies
As early as 1936, UV radiation was associated with decreased influenza transmission in an animal model49 (Wells, 1936) (Table 5). UV radiation was associated with decreased virus transmission and infection incidence in three of the animal studies.49-51 Dee et al52 acknowledged that the lack of effect was likely due to insufficient exposure time to the UV radiation (Table 5).
All  of  the  five  human  studies53-57  were  from  the  1940s  and  investigated  upper-room  UVGI (Table 6). UV radiation was associated with decreased transmission of respiratory infections in three  studies.53,55-56  In  the  studies  of  barracks,  Wheeler  et  al53  found  that  high  intensity  UV
treatment  was  required  to  decrease  transmission.  UV  radiation  was  associated  with  modified spread of transmission, but not prevention of transmission, of measles54 and chickenpox57 but not mumps.57
Risk of bias
The risk of bias evaluation for the experimental studies demonstrated three scenarios (Table 7). Seventeen  studies  had  low  risk  of  bias  for  all  three  domains:  selection  bias,  information  bias,
confounding. Seven studies had low risk of bias for selection bias and confounding but unclear risk of bias for information bias due to lack of clarity in the description of the UV radiation. Of

these seven studies, four were aerosolized virus studies, two were animal studies, and one was a human study. One aerosolized virus study had low risk of bias for selection bias but high risk of bias for information bias and confounding due to lack of calibration of fluorescent bioaerosol count (FBC) and potential for UV radiation to affect fluorescence. Su et al58 cite other studies where FBC  and  cultures  provided  a  predictable  functional  relationship  which  could  be  seen  as  a calibration of this potentially powerful and useful measurement tool; however, they do not provide such a relationship. Their FBC and culture data are not compared in a way that readers can clearly see how an FBC measure predicts a concentration of a pathogen in question. Su et al58(p8) recognize that  “[t]here  is  no  available  research  about  how  UV  light  affects  bioaerosols  that  generate  a fluorescence signal.” The risk of bias evaluation for the seven modelling studies resulted in low risk of bias for all three domains (Table 8): definition, assumption, validation.
Discussion
UV  inactivation  of  airborne  viruses  is  governed  by  the  UV  dose.  The  required  dose  varies depending on the type of virus, capsid structures, and host cell repair mechanisms59. Tseng and Li32 found that dsRNA and dsDNA viruses required a dose that was 2 times higher than their single strand counterparts for 90% inactivation. Walker and Ko10 came to a similar conclusion when they found that adenovirus was more resistant to inactivation compared to SARS. This resistance is
attributed to the double stranded nature of its DNA genome and its ability to shield or consume UV radiation using small proteins concentrated along with viral particles59.
External  factors  such  as  ventilation  and  relative  humidity  also  play  an  important  role  in  UV effectiveness. Relative humidity is uniquely intertwined with UV inactivation. Many studies in this  systematic  review  indicate  that  relative  humidity  has  a  marked,  sometimes  statistically

significant  effect  on  UV  inactivation10-13,33.  Further  research  must  be  done  to  ascertain  the
interaction of relative humidity and UV inactivation in a real-world context with a diverse list of infectious agents. The effect of ventilation on UV effectiveness is similarly complex. Increasing ventilation rate and UVGI are inversely related. At a higher ventilation rate infectious agents are removed from the space at a faster pace. This results in shorter exposure times thereby decreasing the effectiveness of the UVGI system41. Dee et al52 stated that in their experiments UVC provided no reduction in aerosol transmission of PRRSV due to insufficient exposure time. McDevitt et al12 argued that the combination of increased ventilation and upper room UVC is “more than merely additive”.  The  overall  effect  of  a  higher  ventilation  rate  results  in  an  increase  in  the  ACHuv (effective  ventilation  due  to  UVC).  Li  et  al43  came  to  a  similar  conclusion  that  while  UV
disinfection  efficiency  decreases  when  ventilation  rate  increases,  the  overall  infectious  agent
removal rate increases.  In addition to ventilation rates, airflow patterns  can have  a meaningful impact on UVGI effectiveness47. Well mixed air allows UVGI to be more effective12,41,47. UVGI
systems should be designed specifically for the targeted space. Ventilation rate, airflow patterns, and relative humidity should all be taken into consideration. In spaces with no ventilation systems or where increasing the ventilation rate would not be feasible, UVGI can provide cost effective air disinfection60. Spaces with a low outdoor air fraction can also benefit by adopting UVGI50. When considering upper room UVGI, lamp placement can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the inactivation47. UV devices set on a wall rather than the corners of the room improves the effectiveness of the UVGI system43. Building owners and operators should consult an expert when examining the feasibility of installing UVGI in their space. First et al41(p328) states that “upper-room UVGI must be approached as a carefully interdependent system with critical interactions among
luminaire selection, luminaire placement, and all aspects of a ventilation system.”

When  investigating  the  effectiveness  of  UVGI  it  is  important  to  carefully  consider  the  viral challenge and ensure the experiment mimics natural conditions. Even though Jensen36(p420) used
viral aerosol  concentrations that were  “many times greater than one would normally expect to encounter  under  natural  conditions”,  they  stated  that  UVGI used  in  conjunction  with  filtration “should kill virtually all viruses”. Walker and Ko10 discussed the importance of aerosolization, sampling, and medium. Some viruses might be inactivated in the act of aerosolization or sampling; a medium with a high protein concentration might protect the targeted virus from inactivation10. UV susceptibility in liquid suspensions cannot be substituted for susceptibility in aerosols. Walker and Ko10 found that for the viruses they tested, UV susceptibility was higher in aerosols than in liquid suspensions. Attenuated strains of infectious agents can be used as a safer alternative to the actual virus as they are expected to closely mimic the behaviour of the actual viruses compared to an alternative surrogate39. With regards to safety, Welch et al34 and Buonanno et al15 have proposed
the  use  of  far  UVC  (222  nm)  as  a  safer  alternative  to  conventional  UVGI  (254  nm).  It  was demonstrated  that  far  UVC  has  a  similar  inactivation  efficiency  to  conventional  UVGI  for aerosolized coronavirus while not appearing to be cytotoxic to human cells and tissues in vitro or in vivo15,61.
Airborne transmission of respiratory pathogens is a serious issue. Like improving filtration and
increasing ventilation, UVGI is a passive mitigation measure that can have an important impact on virus transmission. No responsibility is placed on the individuals in the space. Langmuir et al56 suggests that upper room UVGI by itself is not an adequate method of air disinfection. A well designed  UVGI  system  should  work  in  conjunction  with  other  mitigation  measures  such  as adequate filtration and ventilation36,43,44,47,51. Perkins54 and Bahlke57 found that even in the event of an outbreak, the use of UVGI led to low grade protracted epidemics of measles and chickenpox

respectively, as opposed to large explosive episodes. The effectiveness of UVGI has been known
for  a  long  time.  The  benefits  of  a  well  designed  UVGI  system  outweigh  the  principal  and maintenance costs55. The time has come for UVGI to be considered as essential as ventilation and
filtration.
The  results  of  this  systematic  review  revealed  several  important  findings.  First,  viruses  and bacteriophages were inactivated by UV radiation. Second, increasing UV dose was associated with
decreasing survival fraction of viruses and bacteriophages. Third, increasing relative humidity was
associated  with  decreasing  susceptibility  to  UV  radiation.  Fourth,  UV  dose  and  corresponding survival fraction were affected by  airflow pattern, ACH, and  UV device location. Finally, UV radiation was associated with decreased transmission in both animal and human studies. While
some of these findings may be well-established in the UV / technical literature, the value of this review is in bringing together this information in a comprehensive and rigorous manner to inform practical applications and set-up of UV systems in the built environment to assist with infection control. Further, we have identified gaps in the scientific literature that warrant attention to advance this important field.
Studies characterized as in-duct UVGI are designed with mechanically induced air flow with a controlled mean velocity which transports air through an irradiated zone  inside a duct. In-duct UVGI lends itself to greater experimental  control of the UV dose than the upper-room  UVGI, although laminar duct flow, non-uniform velocity profiles, and radiation distribution always lead to some dose variance for in-duct systems. Also, in-duct configurations tend to simulate practical conditions where UVGI is installed in HVAC systems or air purifiers. Non-enclosed systems like upper-room UVGI depend on air circulation to drive the particles to an irradiated zone near the ceiling and does not require a controlled mean velocity: air moves through the UV zone generally

due to air currents which are subject to room-scale turbulence. Thus their evaluation becomes more
complex, needing to take into account ventilation configurations, air currents and lamp installation
locations.
Two main thrusts of the research emerged: (1) research that focused on the effect of UV radiation on aerosolized virus survival and (2) research that considered some or all of the transmission chain
from  infected  host  to  aerosolized  virus  to  infected  target  where  specific  UV  radiation
configurations or scenarios were evaluated.
Implications for research
Future research must ensure that UV dose and UV design requirements are clearly described within the context of their own study in order to simplify comparison between studies.  A common metric used for quantifying the effects of  UV on  airborne pathogens  was  the measure of the survival fraction,  comparing  a  quantity  before  and  after  the  UV  intervention.  This  metric  is  easy  to understand but is highly dependent on the configuration of the system for exposing the aerosol to UV radiation. It shows how a system in its entirety kills or inactivates the pathogen in question, but does not isolate the more fundamental dose-response as the susceptibility (Z) measure, which is the exponent or linear slope on a semi-log Cartesian plot of the UV dose versus survival fraction. An encouraging and important trend evident in this body of work is the general evolution toward more rigorous control of experimental conditions which lend themselves to clear quantification of
dose-response. Knowing that not all UV sources are alike, and that flux divergence, reflection, air
velocity profile and lack of turbulence can lead to non-uniform UV radiation of aerosols allows researchers to focus on comparing susceptibility (Z) values, a single parameter. In some cases, the UV  radiation  and  aerosolized  virus  studies  were  able  to  provide  the  mechanistic  quantitative

measure of susceptibility (Z) which is useful for cross study comparisons and is an important input
parameter in modelling studies.
In addition to research examining the effect of UV radiation on aerosolized virus survival, the other main focus was research considering some or all of the transmission chain from infected host to aerosolized virus to infected target under specific UV radiation conditions. These results tend to be somewhat anecdotal because there is no standard test for the full transmission chain between
two or more people sharing breathing space in the built environment. This is a common challenge
in many fields of research. There would be value if the community moved to a more standardized
test  case  configuration  such  as  a  standard  room  and  ventilation  system  configuration,  so  that discrepancies  attributable to  factors  such  as  geometry  and  flow  field  could  be  eliminated.  The ASHRAE 185.1 standard states “Test standards form the foundation for air-cleaner selection in
the ventilation industry. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) literature states that the most important need in the area of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is industry standards to rate installed devices.”62(p2)
All human studies of upper-room UVGI that we identified were field studies conducted between 1945-1949. In a historical review, Reed63 indicates that UVGI fell out of favour after the 1940s
due to inconsistent UV effects on measles transmission in schools, which were later attributed to
measles exposure outside of schools. Additionally, no human studies on virus transmission and UV radiation were found after the 1940s which is a time period before vaccinations for measles,64 chickenpox,65  and  mumps.66  Reed63  attributes  more  recent  attention  on  UVGI  to  bacteria, tuberculosis, and viruses, influenza and SARS. In the current review, recent studies of UVGI are
modelling studies in hospital settings from 2006 to 2020 in which influenza (2011) and coronavirus

(2020) were considered. More field studies of upper-room UVGI are warranted to advance our
understanding of its applicability.
Implications for practice
The design of the UVGI for implementation in a building environment, whether in-duct or upper- room, should consider which virus is targeted. An additional consideration is how the susceptibility of that virus is affected by changes in relative humidity (Figure 2). If more than one infectious agent is targeted, then a range of susceptibilities should be considered. Jaynes et al51 designed their UVGI  system  to  target  one  bacteria  and  two  viruses  (Table  5).  Practical  application  of  UVGI systems should take into account lessons learned from modelling studies; i.e. UV dose produced by the UV system may be affected by the airflow pattern, ACH and UV device location.43-45,47
Generally, in-duct UVGI can be used to prevent in-building transmission when ventilation supply air  has  some  fraction  which  is  recycled,  a  practice  which  is  a  common  means  to  reduce heating/cooling  costs.  Also,  in-duct  UVGI could  be  incorporated  into  a  ducted  air  purification system which exhausts back into the source space directly and might be a tool used to remove airborne virus in a space at a rate higher than could be achieved by the building air handling system alone.  In  both  of  these  cases  the  survival  of  pathogen  after  UV  exposure  would  need  to  be extremely low for them to be effective (though in practice in-duct systems would generally operate in  series  with  aerosol  removal  by  filtration).  A  consensus  on  an  acceptable  standard  for  virus
reduction due to UV treatment might be helpful. Experimental studies may benefit from using the ASHRAE  Standard  52.2  test  duct  which  has  been  used  in  recent  filtration  studies.67-68  Simply seeing more studies recognize that UV radiation dose is dependent on the radiant flux, which is often not uniform, shows a positive trend. For ducted systems, flow that is well-mixed and close to uniform in velocity profile is helpful in evenly dosing aerosols with UV.

Upper-room  UVGI  is  specifically  designed  to  reduce  the  buildup  of  pathogen  in  the  shared
breathing space of occupants and in this technology there is definitely no standard for what is an acceptable performance for these systems. As was done by First et al,41 Rudnick and First,42 and McDevitt et al,12 the equivalent ACH does seem to be a sensible way to calibrate these systems.
Two experimental studies15,34 and one modelling study44 investigated the effects of far-UVC light (222  nm)  on  virus  survival  as  an  alternative  to  conventional  UVC  light  sources.  Viruses  used included human coronaviruses alpha HCoV-229E and beta HVCo-OC43,15 SARS-CoV-2,44 and Influenza A (H1N1).34 While conventional UV has been shown to reduce virus survival fractions, conventional UV can be carcinogenic and cataractogenic34,44 and a health hazard when exposed directly.15 Far-UVC light has been posited as an option for UV radiation as, since far-UVC light has a lower range “of less than a few micrometers, and thus it cannot reach living human cells in the skin or eyes,” the range is still greater than that of viruses, allowing UVC light to “penetrate and kill them.”15(p1) Given concerns of ozone generating by 185nm UV, Welch et al34 measured O3 concentration and could not detect ozone with their 5ppb threshold of detection.
Conclusion
This review provides a comprehensive and rigorous synthesis of the existing scientific literature examining the effectiveness of UV radiation and virus survival and transmission. Experimental studies of UV radiation have consistently demonstrated high susceptibility of viruses (or simulant agents) with sufficient UV dose. At this time, the UV susceptibility of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2
has yet to be reported.  However, there are few studies examining the effect of UV radiation outside
laboratory  or  simulated  settings.  Further,  future  field  studies  of  real-world  implementations  of

UVGI need to take into account the various factors that exist within ventilated indoor spaces that
may modify UV effectiveness, including humidity, airflow pattern, air changes per hour, and UV
device location. Research is needed to provide evidence of the effect of UV radiation along the
chain of transmission in non-simulated “real life” settings.

 Each colour represents one study. Reported RH ranges shown as average RH values. 
 ~Cutler at al33 reported that susceptibility (Z) was significantly lower at ≥80%RH (shown at 80%RH) compared with 25%-79%RH (shown at 52%RH). 
 *Walker and Ko10 calculated susceptibility from a single dose and corresponding survival fraction, rather than dose-response of UV dose and survival fraction. 
 ^ Lin et al35 calculated susceptibility from a single dose and corresponding survival fraction for “fast decay” and from the dose-response of UV dose and survival fraction for “slow decay”.
