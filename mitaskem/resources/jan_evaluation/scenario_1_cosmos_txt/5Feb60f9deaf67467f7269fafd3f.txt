Abstract
15 Background As of July 2021, more than 180,000,000 cases of COVID-19 have been 16 reported across the world, with more than 4 million deaths. Mathematical modelling 17 and forecasting efforts have been widely used to inform policy-making and to create 18 situational awareness. 19 Methods and Findings From 8th March to 29th November 2020, we produced 20 weekly estimates of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and forecasts of deaths due to COVID- 21 19 for countries with evidence of sustained transmission. The estimates and forecasts 22 were based on an ensemble model comprising of three models that were calibrated using 23 only the reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in each country. We also 24 developed a novel heuristic to combine weekly estimates of transmissibility and potential 25 changes in population immunity due to infection to produce forecasts over a 4-week 26 horizon. We evaluated the robustness of the forecasts using relative error, coverage 27 probability, and comparisons with null models.

28 Conclusions During the 39-week period covered by this study, we produced short- 29 and medium-term forecasts for 81 countries. Both the short- and medium-term forecasts 30 captured well the epidemic trajectory across different waves of COVID-19 infections with small relative errors over the forecast horizon. The model was well calibrated with 56.3% 31 32 and 45.6% of the observations lying in the 50% Credible Interval in 1-week and 4-week 33 ahead forecasts respectively. We could accurately characterise the overall phase of the 34 epidemic up to 4-weeks ahead in 84.9% of country-days. The medium-term forecasts 35 can be used in conjunction with the short-term forecasts of COVID-19 mortality as a 36 useful planning tool as countries continue to relax stringent public health measures that 37 were implemented to contain the pandemic.

Introduction
39 As of July 2021, more than 4 million deaths have been attributed to COVID-19 with 40 over 180 million cases reported globally [1]. The scale of the current pandemic has 41 led to a widespread adoption of data-driven public health responses across the globe. 42 Epidemiological quantities such as the reproduction number and the herd immunity 43 threshold have become a part of the public discourse, used by governments to plan 44 their response and by the media to aid public understanding of the health emergency. 45 Outbreak analysis and real-time modelling, including short-term forecasts of future 46 incidence, have been used to inform decision making and response efforts in several 47 past public health challenges including the West African Ebola epidemic and seasonal 48 influenza [2–11]. In the current pandemic, mathematical models have helped public 49 health officials better understand the evolving epidemiology of SARS–CoV-2 [12–14] and 50 the potential impact of implementing or releasing interventions. Short-term forecasts of 51 key indicators such as mortality, hospitalisation, and hospital occupancy have played a 52 similarly important role [15–20], contributing to planning public health interventions 53 and allocation of crucial resources [21–25]. At the same time, the unprecedented level 54 of public interest has placed epidemiological modelling under intense media scrutiny. 55 While model validation against observed data is part of a typical analysis pipeline, in 56 light of the prominent role mathematical models have had in policy planning during 57 the COVID-19 pandemic, retrospective assessment of modelling outputs against later

58 empirical data is critical to assess their validity. 59 With the aim of improving situational awareness during the ongoing pandemic, since 60 the 8th March 2020 we have been reporting weekly estimates of transmissibility of 61 SARS-CoV-2 and forecasts of the daily incidence of deaths associated with COVID-19 62 for countries with evidence of sustained transmission [26]. We have developed three 63 models that are calibrated using the latest reported incidence of COVID-19 cases and 64 deaths in each country that we combine into an ensemble model. 65 All models make implicit or explicit assumptions about the data-generating process 66 being modelled. In addition to the uncertainty associated with the model outputs, 67 there is inherent structural uncertainty about the models themselves as each model 68 makes different assumptions about transmission in attempting to approximate the true 69 underlying processes. Ensemble models, which combine outputs from different models, 70 are a powerful way of incorporating the uncertainty from a range of models [27,28]. They 71 are used widely in diverse fields such as weather forecasting, economics, ecology and are 72 increasingly being used in infectious disease forecasting. Ensemble models can produce 73 more robust forecasts than individual models [28–31]. The estimates of transmissibility 74 and short-term forecasts presented here are based on a novel ensemble model that was 75 calibrated across multiple waves of the pandemic. 76 Forecasts are typically produced under the assumption that the trend in growth 77 remain the same over the forecast horizon. This is a plausible assumption for the 1-week 78 forecast horizon that we used for our short-term forecasts. However, this assumption is 79 likely to be violated over a long forecast horizon for a rapidly evolving epidemic such as 80 COVID-19, leading to a rapidly increasing uncertainty as the forecast horizon grows. 81 We have developed a novel approach relying on a simple heuristic that combines past 82 estimates of the reproduction number, explicitly accounting for the predicted future 83 changes in population immunity, to produce forecasts over longer time horizons. Here we summarise the key transmission trends from our work on global short-term 84 85 forecasts between 8th March to 29th November 2020. We provide a rigorous quantitative assessment of the performance of the ensemble model. We also present medium-term 86 87 forecasts using our approach and retrospectively assess the performance of our method. 88 Our results for medium-term forecasts suggest that we can accurately forecast the 89 trajectory of COVID-19 in several countries for horizons spanning up to 4 weeks.

Materials and methods

91 Methods for estimating transmissibility during epidemics typically rely on the time series 92 of incident cases combined with the natural history parameters of the pathogen [32, 33]. 93 However, in the current pandemic, interpretation and comparison of estimates across 94 countries based on the number of cases was made difficult by the differences in case 95 definitions, testing regimes, and variable reporting across countries as well as over time 96 within each country [34]. We therefore developed methods that relied on the number of reported deaths to estimate COVID-19 transmissibility and to produce short-term 97 98 forecasts of deaths. Since we use deaths to estimate transmissibility, our estimates reflect 99 the epidemiological situation with a delay corresponding to the delay from infection to 100 death [35] . Despite this, our estimates and the short-term forecasts contributed and 101 continue to contribute to situational awareness by providing near real-time insights into 102 the dynamics of the pandemic. They also provide useful, albeit indirect, evidence into 103 the effectiveness of various interventions such as lockdowns and the impact of reopening. 104 The instantaneous reproduction number is frequently used to quantify transmissibility. 105 It is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an individual infected at 106 time t would generate if conditions remained as they were at time t [36]. When applied 107 to the incidence of deaths (rather than cases), the instantaneous reproduction number 108 RD t represents the average number of secondary deaths “generated by” the death of a 109 primary case at time t. We developed three different models, each of which estimated 110 transmissibility in the recent past and produced forecasts of COVID-19 deaths. We then 111 incorporated the outputs of these models to build an ensemble model. We produced 112 short-term forecasts (i.e. 1-week ahead), for which changes in the population immunity 113 level could be ignored. We also produced medium-term forecasts (up to 4-weeks ahead) 114 accounting for the depletion of the susceptible population due to the increased levels of 115 natural host immunity. The methods underlying the individual models are illustrated in 116 Fig. 1. 117 Hereafter, Dt and Ct represent the number of reported COVID-19 deaths and cases 118 at time t respectively. Since we only used reported deaths to estimate transmissibility, 119 for ease of notation, we drop the superscript D from RD t and use Rt to denote the 120 instantaneous reproduction number with respect to deaths at time t. R[t1, t2] is the

121 reproduction number between times t1 and t2. The most recent estimate of transmissi- 122 bility is denoted as Rcurr . We use ω to denote the serial interval distribution of deaths T 123 i.e. the interval between the deaths of an infectee and their infector, where both the 124 infector and the infectee die. Estimated incidence of deaths at time t is denoted by (cid:98)Dt. 125 T refers to last time point in the existing incidence time series of cases or deaths.
126
Model 1 (RtI0)
127 The first model relies on a well-established method [37] that assumes the daily incidence 128 of deaths is approximated with a Poisson process following the renewal equation [36]: (cid:32) (cid:33) t(cid:88)
(cid:32) (cid:33) t(cid:88) 129 (1) Dt ∼ P oisson Dt−sωs Rt s=1 130 A standard approach to inferring recent transmissibility from an incidence time 131 series relies on the assumption that the effective reproduction number is constant over a 132 window (i.e. the “calibration window”) back in time of size τ time units (for example 133 days or weeks) [33]. Adopting a similar approach here, we estimated Rt using only 134 the data in a fixed time-window (of τ days) prior to the most recent observation to 135 calibrate the model. We estimated the average transmissibility R[T − τ + 1, T ] over 136 that time-window, but made no assumptions regarding the epidemiological situation or 137 transmissibility prior to this calibration window (Fig. 1a). Instead, we jointly estimated 138 (using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)) combinations of R[T − τ + 1, T ] and the 139 incidence of deaths prior to the calibration window (cid:98)Dt for t = {1, 2, . . . T − τ} that 140 are consistent with the observed deaths in the time window [T − τ + 1, T ]. The model 141 likelihood is given by

143 most recent estimate of transmissibility Rcurr in this model is R[T − τ + 1, T ]. We T 144 then sampled sets of back-calculated early incidence time series ((cid:98)D1, . . .(cid:98)DT−τ ) and 145 reproduction numbers (R[T − τ + 1, T ]) from the joint posterior distribution obtained in 146 the estimation process, and projected future incidence (cid:98)DT +i for i ≥ 1 conditional on 147 these as follows:

148 where (cid:98)Dt = Dt for t = T − τ + 1, . . . , T . During the period covered in the analysis, 149 the epidemiological situation in most countries was changing rapidly with public health 150 measures being reviewed weekly. At the same time, there was a strong ‘weekend effect’ 151 in the observed data, with typically fewer deaths reported on Saturdays and Sundays. 152 We therefore assumed a fixed calibration window of 10 days to incorporate the rapid 153 dynamics and offset the lower reporting over the weekend. We ran the MCMC for 10000 154 iterations. We sampled 1000 sets of Rcurr and back-calculated incidence, and for each T 155 sampled set, we drew 10 stochastic realisations of the projected incidence of deaths.
156
Model 2 (APEestim)
157 Similarly to Model 1, Model 2 relies on the renewal equation (Eq. (1)) but uses the full 158 time series of observed deaths, and uses information theory to optimise the choice of the 159 calibration window i.e. the time-window of size τ over which R[T − τ + 1, T ] is assumed 160 to be constant in the estimation process [38]. Choices of window size can influence the 161 bias and variance of resulting estimates of transmissibility [39]. We integrated over the 162 entire posterior distribution of Rt (under a given window size), to obtain the posterior 163 predictive distribution of incidence at time t + 1 as
(cid:90) 164 (4) P (Dt+1 | D1, D2, . . . Dt) = P (Rt) P (Dt+1 | D1, D2, . . . Dt, Rt) dRt R[t−τ +1,t]

where R[t − τ + 1, t] represents the posterior distribution of Rt assuming a window 165 166 of length τ . We computed this distribution sequentially for t ∈ {1, 2, . . . T − 1} and then 167 evaluated every observed count of deaths according to their likelihood under the posterior
168 predictive distribution. This allowed us to construct the accumulated predictive error 169 (APE) for a window length τ and under a given serial interval distribution as [38]:
T−1(cid:88) (5) AP Eτ = − log P (Dt+1 | D1, D2, . . . Dt) t=1
170 Here, Dt+1 is the observed number of deaths at time t+1. The optimal window length 171 τ∗ was then chosen as the window for which AP Eτ is minimised (Fig. 1b), optimising 172 the bias-variance trade-off (long windows reduce the estimate variance but increase bias 173 and short windows do the converse). 174 Again, forward projections were made assuming that transmissibility over the projec- tion horizon remains the same as that in the last τ∗ days. That is, Rcurr
175 tion horizon remains the same as that in the last τ∗ days. That is, Rcurr is set to be T 176 R[T − τ∗ + 1, T ]. We then obtain forecasts of deaths as

177 for i ≥ 1. We drew 1000 samples from the posterior distribution of Rcurr and for T 178 each sampled value, simulated 10 forward trajectories.
Model 3 (DeCa)
180 Models 1 (RtI0) and 2 (APEestim) use only the time series of deaths to estimate Rt. 181 Model 3 exploits the signal from both the reported deaths and cases to forecast deaths.
182 We assumed that the delay δ between a case being reported and the case dying (for those 183 who die) is distributed according to a gamma distribution with mean µ and standard 184 deviation σ. Let fΓ be the probability mass function of a discretised gamma distribution. ∞(cid:80)

188 quantity at time t can be thought of as an observed case fatality ratio (Fig. 1c). We
189 assume that deaths are distributed according to a binomial distribution:
(cid:33) (cid:32) ∞(cid:88) . (7) Dt ∼ Binomial fΓ(x | µ, σ)Ct−x, ρt 0
190
The model likelihood is given by
L (ρ1, ρ2, . . . , ρT | C1, . . . , CT , D1, D2 . . . DT , µ, σ) T(cid:89) = P (Ds | C1, . . . , Cs, ρs, µ, σ) (8) s=1 (cid:33) T(cid:89) (cid:32) ∞(cid:88) Binomial . = fΓ(x | µ, σ)Ct−x, ρt | C1, . . . Cs, ρs, µ, σ s=1 0
191 We obtained a posterior distribution for ρ1, ρ2, . . . , ρT using the conjugate beta 192 prior for ρt (using the R package binom [40]), assuming that parameters of the delay 193 distribution µ and σ are known and fixed. The forecasted number of deaths at time T + i for i ≥ 1 were then drawn from a binomial distribution as
194 T + i for i ≥ 1 were then drawn from a binomial distribution as

Note that the number of deaths at time T + i depends on the number of cases from 195 the beginning of the epidemic to time T + i for i ≥ 1. That is, for forecasting deaths
196 the beginning of the epidemic to time T + i for i ≥ 1. That is, for forecasting deaths
197 at time T + i, we need the number of cases at time t > T . To augment the observed
198 time series of cases, we assumed that the cases in beyond T are distributed according to
205 from a gamma distribution to augment the observed cases. We then drew 10000 samples
199 a gamma distribution with mean and standard deviation of the observed cases in the
200 last week, implicitly assuming no growth or decline in cases. We assessed the extent to 201 which this assumption affected our results (SI Sec. 4). Finally, to include transmissibility 202 estimates from this model in the ensemble, we estimated Rcurr using the observed and T 203 median forecasted deaths D1, . . . DT ,(cid:98)DT +i for i ≥ 1. using the R package EpiEstim [33]. 204 We drew 10000 samples from the posterior distribution of ρT and 10000 samples

Ensemble Model
209 We combined the estimates of Rcurr , and the outputs of models RtI0, APEestim, and T 210 DeCa into an unweighted ensemble model by sampling the forecasts and reproduction 211 number from each model described above. We also explored building a weighted ensemble 212 by weighting the contribution of each model according to the relative error of the model 213 in the previous week, all previous weeks, across all countries, or estimating the weights 214 independently for each country. We did not find any substantial difference in the 215 performance of the unweighted and weighted ensembles (not shown here). We therefore 216 restricted our analyses to an unweighted ensemble model. 217 We first drew 10000 samples from the posterior distribution of Rcurr and forecasts T 218 from each model and then sampled each posterior distribution with equal weight to build 219 the ensemble posterior distribution of Rcurr and corresponding forecasts.

Short-term forecast horizon
221 The short-term forecast horizon was set to be 1 week. We produced forecasts for the 222 week ahead (Monday to Sunday) using the latest data up to (and including) Sunday. 223 We did not model the potential changes in the population immunity levels as any such 224 change is not expected to affect the trajectory of the epidemic over this short time 225 horizon.
226
Medium-term forecasts
227 Over the course of the epidemic, the effect of the potential depletion of the susceptible 228 population on the trajectory of the epidemic may become more pronounced. Inherently, 229 by estimating transmissibility in real-time, the models outlined above account for any 230 general decrease in the proportion of population being susceptible. However, the forecasts 231 produced do not account for any further decrease in this proportion, which may become 232 substantial when forecasting over a medium- to long-term time horizon.

233 Estimating transmissibility for medium-term forecasts
234 To better capture ongoing trends in transmissibility over time, we examined changes in
235 past ensemble estimates of Rcurr in consecutive weeks. To forecast over a time horizon T 236 longer than a week, we developed a novel heuristic that uses, in addition to the estimates
237 of Rcurr , estimates from earlier weeks which are combined into a single weighted estimate T 238 Rw , we went back one week at a time, T as follows. Starting with the estimates of Rcurr T 239 for as long as the 95% credible interval (CrI) of Rcurr (where T (cid:48) < T ) overlapped the T (cid:48) 240 95% CrI of Rcurr . We then sampled from the posterior distribution of Rcurr in each of T T (cid:48) 241 those weeks, with a probability that decays exponentially in the past to favour the more
242 recent estimates. That is, the distribution of Rcurr T with a relative T−7k contributed to Rw 243 weight proportional to e−βk (Fig. 1d). Each week, the rate of decay β was optimised by 244 minimising the relative error in the predictions for the previous week.

Accounting for depletion of the susceptible population due to naturally-
acquired immunity
247 As the weighted reproduction number Rw t already accounts for the population immunity 248 at time t, we first estimated an effective reproduction number Ref f , defined as the t 249 reproduction number if the entire population were susceptible. That is,
(10)
Rw t Ref f t = pS t
250 where Rw is the weighted reproduction number at time t and pS t t is the proportion of 251 population that is susceptible to infection at time t. pS is given by 1 − t(cid:80) Ij/N where t j=0 252 Ij is the number of infections at time j and N is the total population. In estimating 253 the potential future population immunity using this formulation, we only accounted
254 for naturally acquired immunity assuming that the immunity acquired after infection 255 persists. Since we were forecasting deaths (rather than infections), the true number 256 of infections was estimated using a country-specific age-distribution weighted Infection
257 Fatality Ratio (IFR) (SI Sec. 3). 258 We then incorporated the effect of a declining proportion of susceptible population
259 due to naturally acquired immunity as

RS pS t t+i = Ref f t+i
From the ensemble estimates of Rcurr , we first estimated RS T T . The medium-term 260 261 forecasts were then produced using the renewal equation (Eq. (1)) and the forecasts used 262 to update the estimates of RS T +i for each i ≥ 1 over the forecast horizon.
263 Medium-term forecast horizon
264 The medium-term forecasts were made over a 4-week horizon using RS t . Since estimates 265 of the weighted reproduction number could only be obtained once we had sufficient 266 weekly estimates to combine, medium-term forecasts were produced from 29th March to 267 29th November 2020.

269 Following Abbott et al. [41], we defined the epidemic phase in a country at time t using 270 the distribution of the reproduction number at t (Rcurr for the short-term forecasts t 271 and RS for the medium-term forecasts). At time t, we defined the epidemic phase in a t 272 country to be:
273 < 1 in less than 5% of the samples of the posterior 274
• ‘definitely growing’ if Rcurr < 1 in less than 5% of the samples of the posterior t distribution;
275 < 1 in less than 20% of the samples of the posterior 276
• ‘likely growing’ if Rcurr < 1 in less than 20% of the samples of the posterior t distribution;
281
277 • ‘definitely decreasing’ if Rcurr > 1 in less than 5% of the samples of the posterior t 278 distribution;
279 • ‘likely decreasing’ if Rcurr > 1 in less than 20% of the samples of the posterior t 280 distribution;
• ‘indeterminate’ otherwise.

282 Assessing model performance
283 The model forecasts were validated against observed deaths as these became available. To quantitatively assess the performance of the model for both short- and medium-term 284 285 forecasts, we used the mean relative error (MRE) and the coverage probability i.e. the 286 proportion of observations that are in a given credible interval of the distribution of 287 forecasts (SI Sec. 5). Following Gu [42], we compared the absolute error of the model 288 (the absolute difference between the forecasts and observations averaged across simulated 289 trajectories) with the error of a model that used (i) the average of the last 10 observations 290 as a forecast for the week ahead (no growth), and (ii) forecasted using a linear model 291 fitted to the last 10 observations (linear growth).
292 Data and epidemiological parameters
293 We used the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported by the World Health 294 Organisation (WHO) [1]. Any data anomalies were corrected using data published by 295 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [43], or other sources (SI Sec. 2). 296 For the weekly analysis, we defined a country as having evidence of active transmission 297 if at least 100 deaths had been reported, and at least ten deaths were observed in each 298 of the past two weeks (SI Sec. 2). Countries with large variability in the reported deaths 299 within each week over the analysis period were excluded from the final analysis for this 300 work (SI Sec. 2 lists the full exclusion criterion). Results for 81 countries were included 301 in the work presented here. 302 We assumed a gamma distributed serial interval with mean 6.48 days and standard 303 deviation of 3.83 days following [44]. For simplicity, we assumed that the delay in 304 reporting a death is the same as the delay from onset to a case being reported. We 305 assumed that the delay in reporting of deaths follows a gamma distribution with mean of 306 10 days, and standard deviation of 2 days. These figures are roughly consistent with an 307 onset-to-death delay of 15.9 days [45] and onset-to-diagnosis delay of 6.6–6.8 days [46]. 308 The serial interval and delay distributions were discretised using R package EpiEstim [33]. 309 We used a country-specific population-adjusted IFR estimated using the IFR reported 310 in the REACT study (SI Sec. 3).

312 Short-term forecasts and model performance
313 Beginning 8th March 2020, we produced weekly forecasts for every country with evidence 314 of sustained transmission. As the pandemic rapidly spread across the world, the number 315 of countries included in the weekly analysis grew from 3 in the first week (week beginning 316 8th March 2020), to 94 in the last week of analysis included in this study (week beginning 317 29th November 2020) (SI Fig. 1). 318 Overall, the ensemble model performed well in capturing the short-term trajectory of 319 the epidemic in each country. Across all weeks of forecast and all countries, an average 58.7% (SD 32.4%) of the observations were in the 50% credible interval (CrI) and 89.4% 320 321 (SD 21.7%) of the observations were in 95% CrI (for a breakdown by country and week 322 of forecast see SI Sec. 5.5). 323 The MRE across all countries and all weeks was 0.4 (SD 0.4) (Fig. 3). That is, on 324 average the model forecasts were 0.4 times lower or higher than the observed incidence. 325 In most countries, the reporting of both cases and deaths through the week was variable, 326 with fewer numbers reported on some days of the week (typically, Saturday and Sunday). The variability in reported deaths strongly influenced the model performance. The MRE 327 328 scaled linearly with the coefficient of variation (ratio of the standard deviation to the 329 mean) in the reported deaths for the week of forecasting. Thus, the error in forecasts 330 was on average similar to the variability in the reported deaths (SI Fig. 6). The MRE of 331 the model scaled inversely with the weekly incidence i.e. the error was relatively large 332 when the incidence was low (SI Fig. 6), as estimates of reproduction number when the 333 incidence is low are inherently more unstable [47]. 334 The model performance was largely consistent across epidemic phases (growing, 335 likely growing, decreasing, likely decreasing and indeterminate) with similar coverage 336 probability and MRE (SI Table 1). The slightly larger proportion of observations in the 50% and 95% credible intervals for the ‘indeterminate’ phase and the larger MRE 337 338 in this phase together suggest that the model was ‘under-confident’ with large credible 339 intervals [48]. 340 We compared the performance of the model with that of a null no-growth model. In 341 most instances, the ensemble model outperformed the null model. In 80.9% of the weeks

342 in ‘definitely decreasing’ phase and 61.4% of weeks in ‘definitely growing’ phase, the 343 absolute error of the model was smaller than the error made by the null model (Fig. 3, 344 SI Sec. 5.2, SI Table 2). The null model performed better when the trajectory of the 345 epidemic in a country was relatively stable exhibiting little to no change over the time 346 frame of comparison. This is to be expected as the null model describes precisely this stable dynamic. Indeed, in 68.1% of the weeks in the ‘likely growing’ phase and 67.1% 347 348 weeks classified as ‘indeterminate’ phase, the absolute error of the model was larger than 349 the error made by the null model. However, the relative error of the model remained 350 small even in countries and weeks where it did not perform as well as the null model. 351 Similarly, our model performed better than a linear growth model across all phases, 352 specifically in 96.4% of the weeks in ‘definitely decreasing’ phase and 70.3% weeks in 353 ‘definitely growing’ phase (SI Sec. 5.3, SI Table 2).
354 Medium-term forecasts and model performance
355 The rapidly changing situation and the various interventions deployed to stem the growth 356 of the pandemic make forecasting at any but the shortest of time horizons extremely 357 challenging [49]. Despite these challenges, we find that our medium-term forecasts were 358 able to robustly capture the epidemic trajectory (Fig. 4) in all countries included in the 359 analysis (4). 360 Overall, the MRE remained small over a 4-week forecast horizon, with errors increasing 361 over the projection horizon (SI Sec. 6.1). We therefore restricted the projection horizon 362 to 4 weeks. The MRE across all countries in 1-week ahead forecasts was 0.4 (SD 0.3), 363 increasing to 2.6 (SD 28.3) in 4-week ahead forecasts (Fig. 5, SI Fig. 10). The MRE for 364 1-week ahead forecasts was less than 1 (indicating that the magnitude of the error was 365 smaller than the observation) in 91.1% of weeks for which we produced forecasts. The 366 corresponding figure for 4-week ahead forecasts was 66.0% (SI Table 3). 367 The proportion of observations in the 50% CrI remained consistent across the forecast horizon and varied from 56.3% (SD 33.4%) in 1-week ahead forecasts to 45.6% (SD 368 369 40.9%) in 4-week ahead forecasts (SI Fig. 11, SI Fig. 12). 370 More importantly, using RS t estimates from Eq. (11), we accurately characterised 371 the phase of the epidemic in each country. Across the 81 countries and 2210 weeks

372 (15470 days) for which we produced both short- and medium-term forecasts, the phase 373 definition using the reproduction number estimates from medium-term forecasts (RS t ) 374 was consistent with that using the estimates from the short-term forecasts (Rcurr ) in t 375 87.6% (13559/15470) of country-days (number of countries X number of days for which we produced forecasts. The phase definition using reproduction number estimates from 376 377 medium-term forecasts was updated each day over the forecast horizon while the short- 378 term forecasts assigned the same phase to all days of a week.) in 1-week ahead forecasts 379 and in 84.9% (13138/15470) of country-days in 4-week ahead forecasts (Fig. 6). When 380 the phase definitions using RS were different, the medium-term estimates t and Rcurr t 381 most frequently misclassified them as a phase with greater uncertainty. For instance, 382 in 253 weeks when the epidemic phase was identified as ‘definitely decreasing’ using 383 weekly estimates and incorrectly characterised using medium-term estimates, it was 384 misclassified as ‘likely decreasing’ in 100% (253/253 weeks) of country-days. Similarly, in 385 the misclassified weeks, when the epidemic phase using weekly transmissibility estimates was ‘definitely growing’, the medium-term classification was ‘indeterminate’ in 43.7% 386 387 (1175/2688) and ‘likely growing’ in 56.3% (1513/2688) of the country-days. This mis- 388 characterisation is expected as the uncertainty in estimates of RS t grows over the forecast 389 horizon. Crucially, none of the weeks where RS t misclassified the epidemic phase, the 390 phase using Rcurr indicated the opposite trend (growing classified as decreasing or vice t 391 versa). This finding shows that the medium-term transmissibility estimates can be used 392 a reliable indicator of the overall direction of the epidemic trajectory.

Discussion
394 Models used to forecast COVID-19 cases and/or deaths vary in complexity in the data 395 used for model calibration. More complex and/or granular models rely on multiple 396 data streams including data on hospital admissions and occupancy, testing, serological 397 surveys and data on patient clinical progression and outcomes [21]. Such complex 398 location-specific models can provide crucial insights into the ongoing epidemic and 399 inform targeted public health interventions by synthesising evidence from different data 400 streams. However, scaling such analysis to include multiple geographies is challenging 401 because of the variability in availability and reliability of local surveillance data. The

402 computational time needed to fit complex models make scaling them difficult and delays 403 the timely provision of risk estimates. 404 In addition to the variable availability of surveillance data across countries, the wide- 405 scale societal and behavioural changes brought about by the pandemic impose practical 406 constraints on utilising data that are available for multiple countries. For instance, widely 407 available data on the changes in mobility inferred from mobile phone usage released by 408 Google and Apple were informative of the changes in transmission in the early phase of 409 the COVID-19 pandemic and were used in several modelling studies [50, 51]. Although 410 these data continue to be available, recent evidence suggests a decoupling of transmission 411 and mobility in most countries [35, 52]. Models that relied on such additional data [51] 412 or assumptions about non-pharmaceutical interventions [53] could not fit the observed 413 trajectory well as the situation continued to change over the course of the epidemic. 414 Efforts to model and forecast COVID-19 transmission dynamics must therefore meet 415 the challenges of a long and ongoing pandemic spread over an unprecedented scale. 416 Modelling groups around the world have attempted to meet one or both challenges with 417 various analyses conducted at a sub-national scale [54], at a national scale for a specific 418 country [22, 55–57], and for several countries across the globe [41, 58, 59]. In contrast to 419 models built for a region or country and calibrated using local data, models that aim to 420 provide a global overview must be sufficiently general to describe the epidemic trajectory 421 in a range of countries/regions using widely available data that are consistently available 422 over time.
423 We have produced short-term forecasts and estimates of transmissibility for 81 424 countries for more than 65 weeks at the time of writing implementing three simple 425 models that use only the time series of COVID-19 cases and deaths. We have thus 426 traded particularity for generality, to allow us to carry out analysis for a large number 427 of countries over a long period of time. As our methods make few assumptions and use 428 routine surveillance data, they can be easily used during any other future outbreaks. 429 Despite the challenges inherent in forecasting a fast-moving pandemic in the presence 430 of unprecedented public health interventions, our ensemble model was able to successfully 431 capture the short-term transmission dynamics across all countries included in the analysis 432 with small relative error in the weekly forecasts across different COVID-19 waves in 433 each country. The variable performance of our model in weeks and countries with fewer

434 deaths and/or large variability in reported deaths over weeks reflects this trade-off. 435 In the absence of more detailed data, we assumed that epidemiological parameters 436 such as the delay from onset of symptoms to death were the same across all countries 437 and throughout the period of analysis. These parameters are likely to vary over time 438 and between countries and using country-specific parameters could lead to moderate 439 improvements in the model fits and forecast performance. 440 Due to the variability in testing and reporting of cases across different countries and 441 over time within countries, using the reported number of cases to estimate transmissibility 442 and produce forecasts is difficult without using more complex models. For these reasons, 443 we primarily used deaths to estimate the reproduction number as we assumed that 444 reporting of COVID-19 deaths was more complete and consistent over time and across 445 different country surveillance systems. Although this assumption is unlikely to hold for 446 many countries [60–62], our methods are robust to a constant rate of under-reporting 447 over time as this would not alter the overall epidemic trends. A limitation of our work is 448 that our estimates reflect the epidemiological situation with a delay of approximately 19 449 days (the delay from an infection to a death [53]). Nevertheless, our short-term forecasts 450 and transmissibility estimates provide a valuable global overview and continuous insights 451 into the dynamic trajectory of the epidemic in different countries. They also provide 452 indirect evidence about the effectiveness of public health measures. Future research 453 could investigate integrating more data streams into the models. In addition to the 454 weekly reports that we publish, our work has also contributed to other international 455 forecasting efforts [22, 48, 55]. 456 We developed a simple heuristic to combine past estimates of transmissibility and a 457 decline in the proportion of susceptible population to produce medium-term forecasts. 458 We were able to achieve good model performance in forecasting up to 4 weeks ahead. 459 Consistent with findings from other modelling studies [22], we found that the model 460 error was unacceptably high beyond 4 weeks, suggesting that forecasting beyond this 461 horizon is difficult. Importantly, our characterisation of the epidemic phase using 462 weighted estimates of transmissibility were largely in agreement with that using short- 463 term transmissibility estimates. Thus, our method was successful at capturing the 464 broad trends in transmission up to 4 weeks ahead. The medium-term forecasts can 465 therefore serve as a useful planning tool as governments around the world plan further

466 implementation or relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. 467 Our method incorporates the depletion of susceptible population and hence can in 468 principle be extended to account for increasing population immunity as vaccination is 469 rolled out across the world. However, inclusion of vaccine induced immunity depends 470 on the availability of reliable data on vaccination coverage. Further, even if such data 471 were available, teasing apart the impact of vaccination on transmission and mortality 472 could be non-trivial. In light of these issues, it might be challenging to extend our 473 approach to rigorously assess the effect of vaccination on epidemic trajectory on a global 474 scale. However, our latest estimates of transmissibility indirectly reflect the impact of 475 vaccination on transmission, allowing for the delay from vaccination to full immunity, 476 and from infection to death. As we continue to track COVID-19 transmissibility globally, 477 any temporal changes in transmissibility would implicitly account for the changes due to 478 differential vaccination coverage. 479 Mathematical modelling and forecasting efforts have supported data-driven decision 480 making throughout this public health crisis. Our work has aimed to improve global 481 situational awareness. Using relatively simple approaches, we were able to produce 482 robust forecasts for COVID-19 in 81 countries and provide crucial and actionable insights. 483 This effort is being continued [26] as the world continues to grapple with renewed waves 484 of COVID-19 cases.

Fig 1. Schematic of the models (a) Model 1 assumes a single value for R[T −τ +1, T ]. The model is fitted using only the data in this window (T − τ + 1 to T ) to jointly estimate the initial incidence of deaths and R[T − τ + 1, T ]. (b) Model 2 optimises the window over which Rt is assumed to be constant by minimising the cumulative predictive error over the entire epidemic time series. Estimates from R[T − τ∗ + 1, T ] are used to forecast into the future, with τ∗ the window of optimal length. (c) Model 3 uses data from both cases and deaths. The dashed blue curve represents the incidence of reported cases weighted by the case-report to death delay distribution, where µ is the mean delay. ρt is the ratio of the observed deaths and the weighted cases at time t and is analogous to an observed case fatality ratio. Forecasts of deaths are obtained by sampling from a binomial distribution using the most recent estimate of ρT . See also SI Fig. 3. (d) To obtain medium-term forecasts, we combine the most recent transmissibility estimate Rcurr (shown in dark blue) with estimates of transmissibility in the previous weeks to T produce a weighted estimate of transmissibility Rw T (filled in pink) at time T . Estimates from previous weeks are combined with the most recent estimates if the 95% CrI of estimates in week k, Rcurr . Estimates for weeks where T T−7k overlaps the 95% CrI of Rcurr the 95% CrI overlap are shown in light purple, and where the 95% CrI do not overlap in grey. The dashed horizontal lines represent the 2.5th and 97.5th quantile of Rcurr . T We combine the estimates by sampling from the posterior distribution of Rcurr T−7k with probability proportional to e−β∗k, where β is a rate at which the probability decays as we go back in time.

Fig 2. Short-term forecasts. The short-term forecasts and observed deaths for six countries: Brazil, India, Italy, South Africa, Turkey and the United States of America (USA). For each country, the top panel shows the observed deaths in gray; the solid green line shows the median forecast. The shaded interval represents the 95% CrI of forecasts. The forecasts were produced using the most recent estimates of Rcurr assuming that the T transmissibility remains constant. The bottom panel for each country shows the effective reproduction number (Rcurr ) used to produce the forecasts. The solid green line in the T bottom panel for each country is the median estimate of Rcurr while the shaded region T represents the 95% CrI. The dashed red line indicates the Rcurr T = 1 threshold. Note that the y-axis is different for each subfigure. See SI 2 for results for all other countries.

Fig 3. Short-term forecasts MRE and comparison with null model (a) The mean relative error of the ensemble model for each week of forecast (x-axis) and for each country (y-axis). Dark blue cells indicate weeks where the relative error of the model was greater than 2. (b) The ratio of the absolute error of the model to the absolute error of a no-growth null model that uses the average of the last 10 days as a forecast for the week ahead. Shades of green show weeks for a given country where the ratio was smaller than 1 i.e., the ensemble model error was smaller, and weeks where the ratio was greater than 1 i.e. the ensemble model error was larger than the null model error are shown in shades of red (yellow to red). Dark blue indicates weeks when the ratio was larger than 2. In order to present a representative sample, we first ranked all countries by the percentage of weeks in which ensemble model error was smaller than the null model error. We then selected every third country from the top 75 countries in this list. Results for the selected 25 countries are shown here. See SI Fig. 4 for the results for other countries. Ordering of countries in the figure reflects the order in the ranked list i.e. countries with the highest percentage of weeks with model error smaller than null model error are shown on the top.
