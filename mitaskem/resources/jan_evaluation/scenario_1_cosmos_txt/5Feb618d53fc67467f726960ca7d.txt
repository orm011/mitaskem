Abstract
The time dependent SIR model is extended to simulate infection across spatial boundaries. We used New Jersey data as an example to test the extended SIR model. Infection from neighboring counties are modelled by connectivity matrix where each pair of neighboring counties has an element in the connectivity matrix. The magnitude of this matrix element represents the degree to which the infected from one county can aﬀect the susceptible in one of its neighboring counties. Simulated result from the extended spatial SIR model is compared with observed new COVID-19 cases measured in the 21 counties in New Jersey. The extended model has to solve 84 simulated functions simultaneously and the large number of parameters involved in the spatial SIR model are auto tuned using genetic algorithm. Keywords: SIR model, COVID-19, spatial, genetic algorithm pendence only [1] [10]. Studies investigating 1 Introduction spatial transmission focus on observations [11], SIR model [1] [2] has been used extensively in [12], [13].

elements of the connectivity matrix represents the inﬂuence of infection from the neighbouring counties. Due to the large number of parameters involved, genetic algorithm is used to ﬁne tune the relevant parameters used in the modelling. One noticeable artifact of the genetic algo- rithm is that it prioritizes optimizations for counties with higher numbers of cases, since this optimization will lower the residual more dra- matically. However, this neglects optimizations on counties with fewer cases (See Figure 4). To alleviate this, we separated each county into one of three tiers, which each tier corresponding to a range of cases. By allowing the genetic algorithm to optimize counties within each tier separately, it is able to ﬁrst focus on counties with high cases and then work separately on counties with fewer cases.
Figure 4: The genetic algorithm (red) has not optimized the residual for Hunterdon County well because it has very few cases (at max 40 per day). Also note the importance of smooth- ing the data to remove outliers with 0 cases.

Another problem with the genetic algorithm is its inability to lower the residual past a certain point. Once it reaches this point, further gen- erations will create residuals that hover around approximately the same value. For our study with the 21 counties in NJ, this happens around 2 ∗ 107. This suggests a local stationary point

However, ideally we would 240 never have to intervene and the algorithm would process everything automatically, because hu- man intervention can disrupt the results of other counties due to the spatial connection aspect we implemented. This makes the experiment less applicable to the natural situation of the propa- gation of a virus.
