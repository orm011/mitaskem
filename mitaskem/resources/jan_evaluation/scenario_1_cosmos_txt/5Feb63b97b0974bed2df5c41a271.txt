Abstract Two types of stochastic epidemic models are formulated, in which both infectivity in the latent period and household quarantine on the susceptible are incorporated. With the help of Lyapunov functions and Has’minskii’s theory, we derive that, for the nonautonomous periodic version with white noises, it owns a positive periodic solution. For the other version with white and telephone noises, we construct stochastic Lyapunov function with regime switching to present easily veriﬁable sufﬁcient criteria for the existence of ergodic stationary distribution. Also, we introduce a series of numerical simulations to support our analytical ﬁndings. At last, a brief discussion of our theoretical results shows that the stochastic perturbations and household quarantine measures can signiﬁcantly affect both periodicity and stationary distribution.

1 Introduction
As is known to all, the catastrophic inﬂuences of infectious diseases on the development of the world cannot be ignored, and the struggle between human beings and infec- tious diseases has never stopped. Since Kermack and McKendrick [1] pioneered the SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) epidemic compartmental model, various mathe- matical models have been widely established, and quite a few scholars have achieved many good results which are useful for the control and prevention of the spread of the epidemic [2–11]. It is worth noting that many diseases, such as mumps, HIV etc., have a latent period, which is the period of time between the exposure to a disease- causing agent and the onset of disease the agent causes. It is reasonable to consider the SEIR model, which introduces the latent period by using a compartmental approach. There are intensive literatures about kinds of SEIR models with the efforts of many researchers [2,6,9]. Generally speaking, classic SEIR models assume that the latent individuals are not contagious, and the susceptible individuals may become conta- gious only through contact with the infective individuals. However, this assumption is quite different from features of some transmitted diseases (such as SARS [12] and COVID-19 [13]) with infectivity in the latent period. This fact has been concerned by some scholars and SEIR models with infectivity in the latent period have also been considered, see [12,14,15]. The COVID-19, which is a highly contagious and lethal respiratory virus with a similar incubation time and generation time as SARS coronavirus (see [16]), has spread throughout almost every nation on our planet to become a pandemic since 2019. The time between infections and developing the symptoms is within 2–14 days, and the infected person’s latent period is infectious. To date, COVID-19 has ravaged more than two hundred countries around the world and has caused enormous economic and human losses. The worst scenario is that there was no speciﬁc treatment or vaccine available to prevent at the early stages of the outbreak. For this reason, we have to rely on traditional public health measures to respond to the outbreak, such as isola- tion, quarantine, social distance and community containment [16–18]. Many of these were implemented successfully as effective measures during SARS in 2003, provid- ing impetus to continue such stringent measures for COVID-19. China drew useful lessons learnt from SARS outbreak almost 20 years ago and issued unprecedented gigantic interventions to prevent the propagation of COVID-19, including household quarantine, wearing masks, lockdown and strict constant tracing [19–24]. In a recent investigation, an SEIR epidemic model of deterministic differential equations ˙S(t ) =  − β(1 − η1)S(t )[I (t ) + η2 E (t )] − μS(t ),
(1.1)

has been used by Jiao et al. [25] to model the spread of the epidemic with infectivity in the latent period and household quarantine on the susceptible by focusing on the transmitting features of COVID-19, where  > 0 represents the recruitment rate; β > 0 is the infective rate from S to E; η1(0 < η1 < 1) stands for the household

quarantine rate of the susceptible; η2(0 < η2 < 1) is the rate at which the exposed individuals become infectious in the latent period; δ > 0 stands for the transition rate of becoming infectious after a latent period (δ > η2(θ + α + μ)); μ > 0 is the natural death rate; the hospitalized rate of I is given by α > 0; θ > 0 can be regarded as the rate that I become R; η3 > 0 is the recovery rate of I . The schematic diagram of model (1.1) is shown in Fig. 1 below. Consider the absence of R(t ) in other equations, Jiao et al. [25] only focused on the following three-dimensional model

⎧ ⎨ ˙S(t ) =  − β(1 − η1)S(t )[I (t ) + η2 E (t )] − μS(t ), ˙E (t ) = β(1 − η1)S(t )[I (t ) + η2 E (t )] − (δ + μ)E (t ), ⎩ ˙I (t ) = δE (t ) − (θ + α + μ)I (t ),
. Further- and obtained the basic reproduction number R0 = β(1−η1)[δ+η2(θ+α+μ)] μ(θ+α+μ)(δ+μ) more, they proved that model (1.2) admits a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium if R0 < 1, while the positive equilibrium of model (1.2) is globally asymp- totically stable if R0 > 1. Due to the existence of random phenomena in an ecosystem, epidemic models are unavoidably subjected to the environmental ﬂuctuations. In fact, temperature changes, humidity and media coverage inevitably affect the spread of epidemic. To better explain these phenomena, many researchers have included stochastic perturbations in the pro- cess of epidemic modelling and achieved numerous good results [26–36]. Keeping in mind such an idea, Shangguan and Liu et al. [37] recently incorporated white noises into model (1.2) and assumed that stochastic perturbations on the individuals are pro- portional to S(t ), E (t ), I (t ), and derived a new stochastic version as follows
⎧ ⎨ d S(t ) = [ − β(1 − η1)S(t )(I (t ) + η2 E (t )) − μS(t )]dt + σ1S(t )d B1(t ), d E (t ) = [β(1 − η1)S(t )(I (t ) + η2 E (t )) − (δ + μ)E (t )]dt + σ2 E (t )d B2(t ), ⎩ d I (t ) = [δE (t ) − (θ + α + μ)I (t )]dt + σ3 I (t )d B3(t ), (1.3)
where Bi (t ) represent independent standard Brownian motions with Bi (0) = 0, and σ 2 > 0 represent the intensities of noises, i = 1, 2, 3. They investigated the above i model’s stochastic dynamics such as extinction, persistence in the mean and ergodic

stationary distribution (ESD), and compared with model (1.2) and revealed the effect of white noises on the spread of the disease. Note that periodicity is also an important factor and a quantity of human infectious diseases similarly ﬂuctuate over time and often seasonally spread. The birth rate, death rate, recovery rate and other parameters appear more or less periodicity rather than keeping constant, and hence it is reasonable to further take periodic variation into account in the process of investigating the stochastic epidemic model. The existence of periodic solutions is important for understanding and controlling the transmissibility of the diseases, and is extensively researched as a key point in many literatures [38– 44]. For instance, Lin et al. [39] researched a stochastic non-autonomous periodic SIR model and established the threshold of the disease to occur and also veriﬁed the existence of periodic solutions. The existence of periodic solutions for a stochastic periodic SIS model with general nonlinear incidence proposed by Ramziya et al. [41] was discussed. Inspired by the arguments above, we focus on the stochastic model (1.3) and further investigate a corresponding model with periodic variable coefﬁcients, which yields
⎧ ⎨ d S(t ) = [(t ) − β(t )(1 − η1)S(t )(I (t ) + η2 E (t )) − μ(t )S(t )]dt + σ1(t )S(t )d B1(t ), d E (t ) = [β(t )(1 − η1)S(t )(I (t ) + η2 E (t )) − (δ(t ) + μ(t ))E (t )]dt + σ2(t )E (t )d B2(t ), ⎩ d I (t ) = [δ(t )E (t ) − (θ (t ) + α(t ) + μ(t ))I (t )]dt + σ3(t )I (t )d B3(t ), (1.4)
where the parameters (t ), β(t ), μ(t ), δ(t ), θ (t ), α(t ) and σi (t )(i = 1, 2, 3) involved with the above model (1.4) are positive continuous T -periodic functions. Recalling the stochastic model (1.3), we ﬁnd that white noises are incorporated into the deterministic model (1.2). Next, based on model (1.3), we take a further step to investigate the inﬂuence of telephone noises which can be described as a switching between (ﬁnite) regimes of environment. The switching is without memory with exponential distribution waiting times and the waiting time for the next switch has an exponential distribution [45], which can be modeled by a ﬁnite-state Markov chain. The analysis of stochastic epidemic models with Markov switching has received considerable attention, see [35,42,44,46,47] and the references therein. Motivated by this good idea, we suppose that there exist N regimes and a corresponding version is governed by
⎧ ⎨ d S(t ) = [(k) − β(k)(1 − η1)S(t )(I (t ) + η2 E (t )) − μ(k)S(t )]dt + σ1(k)S(t )d B1(t ), d E (t ) = [β(k)(1 − η1)S(t )(I (t ) + η2 E (t )) − (δ(k)) + μ(k))E (t )]dt + σ2(k)E (t )d B2(t ), ⎩ d I (t ) = [δ(k)E (t ) − (θ (k)) + α(k)) + μ(k))I (t )]dt + σ3(k)I (t )d B3(t ). (1.5)
The switching between these N regimes is given by a Markov chain on the state space S = {1, 2, . . . , N}. This model evolves to a stochastic model with regime switching as

where ξ(t ) is a right-continuous time Markov chain with values in ﬁnite state space S. We assume that the Brownian motions Bi (·) are dependent of the Markov chain ξ(·). For each k ∈ S, the parameters (k), β(k), δ(k), θ (k), α(k), μ(k) and σi (k)(i = 1, 2, 3) are positive constants. Model (1.5) is called a subsystem of model (1.6) and model (1.6) can be regarded as model (1.5) switching from one to another by the law of the Markov chain for all k ∈ S. For the convenience of subsequent sections, we list the following preliminaries. In details, assign R+ = [0,∞), R3+ = {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ R3 : xi > 0, i = 1, 2, 3} and let a complete probability space (,F ,{Ft}t≥0, P) with a ﬁltration {Ft}t≥0 satisfy the usual conditions. For an integral function ℵ(t ) deﬁned for t ∈ R+, we denote (cid:6) t (cid:6)ℵ(cid:7)t = 1 ℵ(s)ds, ℵl = inft∈R+ ℵ(t ) and ℵu = supt∈R+ ℵ(t ). For each vector 0 t £ = (£(1), ..., £(N )), we deﬁne that ˆ£ = mink∈S{£(k)} and ˇ£ = maxk∈S{£(k)}. N The generator for ξ(t ) is deﬁned as  = (γi j )N×N , where γi j = − (cid:7) γi j , and j=1 γi j ≥ 0 (i (cid:8)= j ) is the transition rate from i to j, that is if i (cid:8)= j , γi j  + o(),
(cid:8) if i (cid:8)= j , γi j  + o(), P(ξ(t + ) = j|ξ(t ) = i ) = if i = j , 1 + γi j  + o(),
where  > 0. Assume that ξ(t ) is irreducible, which implies that it has a unique stationary distribution π = {π1, π2, . . . , πN} which can be governed by the equation (cid:7) N π  = 0 subject to πh = 1 and πh > 0 for any h ∈ S. h=1 As a continuation of our previous work [37], the object of the present paper is to examine the effect of environmental variability on the dynamics of disease trans- mission of models (1.4) and (1.6). The rest sections of this work are summarized as follows. We discuss the existence of a positive periodic solution of model (1.4) in Sect. 2. Section 3 establishes sharp sufﬁcient criteria for the ESD of model (1.6). In Sect. 4, several speciﬁc numerical examples are presented to substantiate our analytic results. Lastly, a series of concluding remarks are contained in Sect. 5.

2 Existence of positive periodic solution of (1.4)
The part of this paper, we proceed to discuss the existence of positive periodic solutions of model (1.4). In what follows, let us ﬁrst prepare the following deﬁnition and two lemmas.
2556 D. Shangguan et al. Deﬁnition 2.1 [49] A stochastic process ζ (t ) = ζ (t , ω)(−∞ < t < +∞) is T -period
Deﬁnition 2.1 [49] A stochastic process ζ (t ) = ζ (t , ω)(−∞ < t < +∞) is T -period if for every ﬁnite sequence of numbers t1, t2,··· , tn the joint distribution of random variables ζ (t1 + h), ζ (t2 + h),··· , ζ (tn + h) is independent of h, where h = kT , k = ±1,±2,··· .
A periodic stochastic system is given by
dx(t ) = h(x(t ), t )dt + g(x(t ), t )d B(t ), x ∈ Rn, (2.1)
where both functions h(t ) and g(t ) are T -periodic in t.
Lemma 2.1 [49] Suppose that the coefﬁcients involved with (2.1) are T -periodic and system (2.1) owns a unique global solution. Also, there is a function W (t , x) ∈ C 2 in R which is T -periodic in t and satisﬁes (A1) inf|x|>R W (t , x) → +∞ as R → +∞,
(A1) inf|x|>R W (t , x) → +∞ as R → +∞, (A2) LW (t , x) ≤ −1 outside some compact set.
Then system (2.1) has a T -periodic solution. Lemma 2.2 For any initial value (S(0), E (0), I (0)) ∈ R3+, there is a unique globally
Lemma 2.2 For any initial value (S(0), E (0), I (0)) ∈ R3+, there is a unique globally positive solution (S(t ), E (t ), I (t )) ∈ R3+ of model (1.4) for t ≥ 0 almost surely. Proof Deﬁne a C 2-function V : R3+ → R+ as follows

Theorem 2.1 Model (1.4) owns a positive T -periodic solution if R > 1.

We can easily derive that W (S, E , I , t ) is T -periodic in t, and

where Uκ = (1/κ, κ)× (1/κ, κ)× (1/κ, κ) and the number κ > 1 is sufﬁciently large, which implies that the assumption (A1) in Lemma 2.1 veriﬁed. Now, we continue to conﬁrm that the assumption (A2) in Lemma 2.1. Assign

The above discussions of six cases show that LW ≤ −1, (S, E , I ) ∈ R3+ \ U , which means that the assumption (A2) in Lemma 2.1 also holds. Thus model (1.4) owns a (cid:11)(cid:12) positive T -periodic solution.

where b(·,·) : Rn × S → Rn, σ (·,·) : Rn × S → Rn×n and D(x, k) = σ (x, k)σ(cid:17)(x, k) = (di j (x, k)). For each k ∈ S, we assume that W(·, k) is any twice continuously differentiable function, and the operator L can be described by

LW(x, k) ≤ −α, (x, k) ∈ Dc × S,
LW(x, k) ≤ −α, (x, k) ∈ Dc × S,
then system (2.1) is ergodic and positive recurrent. Namely, there exists a unique stationary distribution π(·,·) such that for any Broel measurable function h(·,·) : Rn × S → R satisfying
(cid:19) N(cid:18) |h(x, k)|π(dx, k) < ∞, Rn k=1
one has
(cid:19) (cid:19) t (cid:20) 1 h(X (s), ξ(s))ds = N(cid:18) |h(x, k)|π(dx, k) P (cid:21) = 1. lim t→∞ Rn t 0 k=1
Lemma 3.2 For any initial value (S(0), E (0), I (0), ξ(0)) ∈ R3+ × S, model (1.6) has a unique globally positive solution (S(t ), E (t ), I (t ), ξ(t )) on t ≥ 0 almost sure.

Proof Since the procedure to prove this lemma is very similar to that of Lemma 2.2, we only give the formulas which are different from those in Lemma 2.2. Assign

where b1 = (ˆδ + ˆμ)/ ˇβ(1 − η1)[η2 + ˇδ/( ˆμ + ˆα + ˆθ )] and b2 = b1 ˇβ(1 − η1)/( ˆμ + ˆα + ˆθ ). Based on the idea of the proof of Lemma 2.2, the remaining proof can be similarly (cid:11)(cid:12) validated.

Proof First, the condition γi j > 0 (i (cid:8)= j) is given by Sect. 1, which is the required assertion of the assumption (B1) in Lemma 3.1. Next, let us verify the assumption (B2) in Lemma 3.1. One can derive the following diffusion matrix of model (1.6)
A = (ai j (S, E , I , k)) =
⎞ ⎛ σ 2 (k)S2 0 0 1 ⎝ ⎠ . σ 2 (k)E 2 0 0 2 σ 2 (k)I 2 0 0 3

for any (S, E , I ) ∈ Dc × S, ζ = (ζ1, ζ2, ζ3) ∈ R3, where
{σ 2 M = (k)S2, σ 2 (k)E 2, σ 2 (k)I 2}, min 1 2 3 (S,E ,I )∈Dc×S
D = [, 1/] × [, 1/] × [, 1/] and the constant  > 0 is sufﬁciently small. Thus, we can obtain that the assumption (B2) in Lemma 3.1 is valid. At last, we need to prove that the assumption (B3) holds. In the same way as in the above proof of the assumption (A2) in Theorem 2.1, hence we only give the formulas which are different from those in Sect. 2.

4 Numerical simulations
In this sequel, we will focus on illustrating the feasibility of theoretical results on models (1.4) and (1.6) by two numerical examples. Assume that initial values of models (1.4) and (1.6) are given by (S(0), E (0), I (0)) = (0.3, 0.4, 0.2).
Example 1 In model (1.4), we ﬁx the parameters (t ) = 1 + 0.1 sin πt, μ(t ) = 0.2+0.1 sin πt, η1 = 0.2, η2 = 0.2, β(t ) = 0.5+0.1 sin πt, θ (t ) = 0.15+0.1 sin πt, δ(t ) = 0.5 + 0.1 sin πt, α(t ) = 0.25 + 0.1 sin πt, σ1(t ) = σ2(t ) = σ3(t ) = 0.01 + 0.05 sin πt. A calculation shows that R ≈ 2.462713 > 1. So it follows from Theorem 2.1 that model (1.4) has a T -periodic solution, we can clearly see Fig. 2. Moreover Fig. 2a, b show that S(t ), E (t ), I (t ) ﬂuctuate periodically.

Example 2 In model (1.6), we assume that the Markov chain ξ(t ) switches among these states S = {1, 2} with the generator

and the corresponding stationary distribution π = (π1, π2) = (0.4, 0.6). Select (1) = 0.9, β(1) = 0.4, α(1) = 0.25, μ(1) = 0.2, θ (1) = 0.15, η1 = 0.2, η2 = 0.2, σ1(1) = 0.05, σ2(1) = 0.05, σ3(1) = 0.05, (2) = 1, β(2) = 0.6, α(2) = 0.3, μ(2) = 0.3, θ (2) = 0.25, η1 = 0.2, η2 = 0.2, σ1(2) = 0.1, σ2(2) = 0.1, = 1.0528286 > 1. So we know from Theorem 3.1 that σ3(2) = 0.1, and then Rs 0 model (1.6) owns a unique ESD, this result is illustrated by Fig. 3.
5 Discussions
As a continuation of our previous work [37], based on the stochastic model (1.3) with infectivity in the latent period and household quarantine, we continue to consider two types of stochastic models, in which the periodic variation and telephone noise are respectively considered (see models (1.4) and (1.6)). Two sets of sufﬁcient criteria are respectively established for the T -periodic solution and the existence of a unique ESD, see Theorems 2.1 and 3.1. From the above theoretical results, the conclusions are summarised below.

2568 D. Shangguan et al. • We can conclude that, by Theorem 2.1, model (1.4) has a positive T -periodic
• We can conclude that, by Theorem 2.1, model (1.4) has a positive T -periodic solution if R > 1. Recalling the expression of R, we ﬁnd that low noise intensities σ 2 (i = 1, 2, 3) and inadequate cooperation from the household quarantine rate η1 i can prevent the disease from dying out, in other words, the disease will ﬂuctuate periodically. • We have shown that, under Theorem 3.1, model (1.6) owns a unique ESD if Rs > 1. This implies that decreasing the noise intensities σ 2 (i = 1, 2, 3) and i 0 the household quarantine rate η1 can lead to a prevalence level of the disease. It is evident that household quarantine, if it is strictly implemented by the govern- ment, plays a crucial role in controlling the disease spread, which is consistent with that of Refs. [25,37]. It’s necessary to point out that China has accomplished an unprecedented gigantic achievement, which beneﬁts from the whole govern- ment’s swift and decisive response in a short time, including the detection of cases to immediate isolation, strict contact tracing, medical observation of all contacts, as well as household quarantine. Particular emphasis is that both household quar- antine and the latent individuals tracing have signiﬁcant inﬂuences on the control of the epidemic.

Finally, we should point out that our present work is only considered the stochastic dynamics of the three-dimensional models (1.4) and (1.6) with variables S, E and I . In fact, it will deserve to respectively incorporate the periodic variation and telephone noise into the variable R in four-dimensional model. Also, some interesting topics deserve further investigation. We can explore the effects of delay [36] or impulse [30] on periodic model (1.4), and may study model (1.6) driven by Lévy jumps [29]. We leave these issues for future consideration.
