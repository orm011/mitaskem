 Abstract For some countries that have experienced numerous natural disasters, including massive earthquakes and tsunamis, managing the COVID-19 pandemic can be very challenging. This situation arises considering that the disaster can directly and indirectly affect the healthcare system's capacity to serve the COVID-19 cases. With severely damaged healthcare facilities due to the disaster, there will be severely ill COVID-19 cases unmanaged. The coupling and interplay between these two phenomena can indeed be catastrophic. One of the regions where this issue becomes concerned is in Southeast Asia, where most of the Asian countries lie in the fragile ring of fire ecosystem, contributing to the high tsunami  and  earthquake  disasters  in  the  world.  At  the  same  time,  Asia  is  one  of  the  regions  that  have  been  severely  impacted  due  to  the current  COVID-19  Delta  Variant.  Recently,  a  more  contagious  Omicron  Variant  has  emerged  and  put  a  more  massive  burden  on  the healthcare  facilities  that  are  impacted  by  disasters.  Then,  in  this  situation,  this  paper  aims to  assess  healthcare  resilience  in  managing  the Omicron pandemic amid disaster impacts. SIR simulation was used to determine whether severely ill Omicron cases were below or above healthcare and ICU capacity under different vaccination coverage. Our result confirms that vaccination coverage was the imminent factor in reducing the severely ill cases in every healthcare facility, whether the facilities were damaged or not. Increasing vaccination coverage from 30% to 60% will significantly reduce the number of severely ill cases that fall below the capacity of healthcare. Based on the current SIR model on the Omicron epidemic variables and Ro, it is estimated that the Omicron will reach its peak after 180 days in February 2022 and will totally disappear in May 2022 in this modeled area. When healthcare system facilities were fully operational and no disaster happened, combined with 60% vaccination rates, all Omicron case numbers were below and under the available hospital beds and even available ICU beds. While the situation is changed when a disaster occurs and causes 30% damage or reduction to healthcare facilities.  In this situation, there are portions of Omicron cases that cannot be managed by the healthcare system since the cases have exceeded the available beds. The situations become more apparent where the healthcare facilities are severely damaged and lose 60% of their functionality. In  this situation, all modeled Omicron cases and even the severe cases have exceeded the ICU capacity.

Besides  that,  healthcare  human  resources  have  been reduced  by  up  to  40%.  As  a  comparison,  similar situations  were  also  observed  in  the  post-earthquake  in Bantul.  As  reported  by  Widayatun  and  Fatoni  (2013), approximately  55.6%  of  healthcare  facilities  were damaged.

 1.3 Omicron On  November  26,  2021  (WHO  2021),  WHO designated  the  SARS-CoV-2  Variant  B.1.1.529  as  a Variant of Concern (VoC) based on advice from WHO's Technical  Advisory  Group  on  Virus  Evolution  (VOC). This  variant  has  been  given  the  name  Omicron.  South Africa reported the Omicron to WHO for the first time on November  24,  2021.  In  South  Africa,  infections  were high  in  recent  weeks,  coinciding  with  the  discovery  of Omicron.  The  first  known  confirmed  Omicron  infection came  from  a  specimen  collected  on  November  9,  2021, and  the  first  publicly  available  sequence  came  from  a specimen  collected  on  November  11,  2021.  The  number of  cases  of  this  variant  appear  to  be  on  the  rise  in  a number  of  South  African  provinces.  The  Omicron  was also  discovered  in  Botswana  in  samples  collected  on November 11, 2021. As of November 28, 2021, at 3 PM, cases had been detected in four additional countries. Omicron has some deletions (Karim and Karim 2021) and more than 30 mutations, some of which overlap with those in the alpha, beta, gamma, or delta VoCs, including 69–70del,  T95I,  G142D/143–145del,  K417N,  T478K, N501Y,  N655Y,  N679K,  and  P681H.  These  deletions and  mutations are known to increase viral transmissibility,  viral  binding  affinity,  and  antibody escape.  Some  of  the  other  known  omicron  mutations confer  increased  transmissibility  and  affect  binding affinity (Greaney et al 2021, Harvey et al. 2021).

 1.4 Case studies Among  five  islands,  Java  is  one  of  the  most populated  islands  that  have  the  most  fragile  ecosystems. This fragility is related to the geological characteristics of Java  Island.  Related  to  this,  the  Java  Island  landscape consists  of  numerous  volcanic  mountains  that  are  still active.  Even  on  December  4,  2021,  Mount  Semeru  in East  has  erupted.  Aside  from  volcanic  mountains,  Java Island is also vulnerable to tsunamis. Imminent causes of tsunamis  on  Java's  island  coasts  are  related  to  the presence of Krakatau, an active volcano in West Java. As a result, in December 2018, Krakatau erupted and caused a  tsunami  on  the  nearby  coastline.  The  most  heavily impacted coast due to the tsunami caused by the Krakatau eruption is the South West Coast of West Java. Besides  being  prone  to  natural  disasters,  the  Java Island  has  the  highest  COVID-19  confirmed  cases.  The record  was  observed  in  the  period  of  June–August  2021 due  to  the  COVID-19  Delta  Variant.  At  that  time,  the surge  of  COVID-19  cases  caused  a  nationwide  bed occupancy rate (BOR) to reach 69%, which exceeded the WHO level of 60%. Java Island recorded the most BOR with  a  range  of  71%-90%.  This  BOR  was  higher  than islands outside the Java Islands, which ranged from 61% to 64%.

A  well-known  Susceptible  Infectious  Recovered (SIR) model was used in this study (Jo et al. 2020, Zhao et  al.  2020).  The  SIR  is  regarded  as  a  versatile compartmental  mathematical  tool  for  modeling  any pandemic dynamic in dealing with the current COVID-19 pandemic.  The  model  aids  us  in  comprehending  the kinetics of a pandemic in any specific aspect, and the SIR model  is  also  simple  to  understand  and  has  clear interpretations (Wagh et al. 2020). The  total  population  (N)  is  divided  into  three compartments  in  the  standard  SIR  model  (Waqas  et  al. 2020).  The  Susceptible  (S),  a  subset  of  the  total population that is vulnerable and at risk of infection, The Infected  (I)  are  people  who  have  been  infected.  The recovered  (R),  which  is  the  percentage  of  the  total population  that  recovers,  Several  input  parameters  must be  considered  in  the  SIR  model.  These  parameters  are denoted as ß. dS/dt=-βSI
2.4 SIR variables SIR consists of epidemic, healthcare, and demography  variables  (Table  2).  The  epidemic  variable consisted  of  the  reproductive  numbers  (Ro)  of  Omicron and  vaccination rates.  While the  healthcare  and demography variables consist of the number of available beds  and  ICUs,  The  model  ran  from  December  2021  to May  2022.  The  period  was  based  on  people  mobilizing for the  end-of-year  holiday  and  warnings from meteorological  and  climatological  agencies  about  a possible  tsunami  due  to  extreme  weather  at  the  end  of December  2021.The  6  month  period  was  chosen considering that the reconstruction of healthcare facilities requires 6 months. The  SIR  was  implemented  at  several  vaccination rates  and  in  the  capacity  of  healthcare  facilities.  The

This  area  was experiencing  massive  tsunami  in  the  last  2018.  The magnitude and damage caused by tsunami can be seen in Table 1.

vaccination  rates  ranged  from  30%,  60%,  and  90%. Similar  rates  were  applied  to  healthcare  capacities.  The available  functional healthcare capacities  were  following the  disaster  impacts  with  the  lowest  capacity  (30%) represents the severe impacts and damages.
3. Results and Discussion The  results  of  simulated  Omicron-related  infectious and severely ill cases related to vaccination coverage and healthcare  conditions  are  available  in  Figure  1-3.  The infections and severely ill cases were simulated according to  the  conditions  of  healthcare  facilities  due  to  the damage  caused  by  natural  disasters  like  tsunamis  and earthquakes.  From  the  results,  first,  it  is  obvious  that vaccination  is  the  most  important  factor  in  reducing  the Omicron cases. These  facts  were  related  to  the  conditions  where,  in every healthcare facility with damage rates of 0–60%, the Omicron  cases  were  always  reduced  to  zero  with vaccination  coverage  close  to  90%.  While  in  almost every  healthcare  situation,  the  severely  ill  cases  were always above healthcare facility capacities if only 30% of the  population  got  the  vaccine.  By  increasing  the vaccination  coverage  up  to  60%,  all  severely  ill  cases were  below  healthcare  facility  capacities  and  under control.

Currently,  the  presence  of  multiple  mutations  of  the spike protein in the receptor-binding domain suggests that  Omicron  may  have  a  high  likelihood  of  immune escape  from  antibody-mediated  protection.  However, immune escape potential from cell-mediated immunity is more  difficult  to  predict.  Overall,  there  are  considerable

uncertainties in the  magnitude  of immune  escape potential of Omicron. Further  research  is  needed  to  better  understand  the escape  potential  against  vaccine-  and  infection  induced immunity. Research efforts are ongoing, and the data are expected  to  be  available  in  the  coming  weeks.  Despite uncertainties,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  currently available  vaccines  offer  some  protection  against  severe disease and death. The  SIR  model  is  considered  a  very  useful  tool  and approach to estimate where a certain epidemic will reach its peak. Based on the current SIR model on the Omicron epidemic  variables,  it  is  estimated  that  the  Omicron  will reach  its  peak  after  180  days  in  February  2022  and  will totally  disappear  by  May  2022.  This  result  is  in agreement  with  other  COVID-19  variant  SIR  models.  In comparison,  the  Delta  variant,  which  is  related  to Omicron  variants,  reached  its  peak  after  18  days.  Using Ro  close  to  1.8,  Saldana  and  Velasco-Hernandez  (2021) found  that  the  simulated  SIR  model  of  Delta  reaches  its peak on the 200th day. While the time when the Omicron will reach its peak depends on the Ro values, As Saldana and  Velasco-Hernandez (2021)  confirm,  with  Ro increasing from 1.8 to 5.0, there is a great possibility that the Omicron can reach its peak just within 20 days. The  most  important  finding  in  this  study  is  how  the disaster  can  affect  the  health  facility's  performance  in mitigating  the  Omicron  cases.  The  impacts  were  clearly visible  where  different  damage  levels  were  applied. When  healthcare  system  facilities  were  fully  operational and  no  disaster  happened,  combined  with  60% vaccination rates, all  Omicron case numbers  were below and under  the  available  hospital beds  and  even  available ICU  beds.  It  means  that  the  Omicron  cases  can  be managed  since  they  are  not  surpassing  the  healthcare capacities (Fig.1). While the situation is changed when a disaster  occurs  and  causes  30%  damage  or  reduction  to healthcare facilities. In this situation, there are portions of Omicron cases that cannot be managed by the healthcare system since the cases have exceeded the  available beds. The  situations  become  more  apparent  where the healthcare  facilities  are  severely  damaged  and  lose  60% of their functionality. In this situation, all Omicron cases and  even  the  severe  cases  have  exceeded  the  ICU capacity (Fig. 2). Our results indicating the healthcare facilities lose its capacity to deliver healthcare service is in agreement with previous  study.  Following  Camp  Fire  events, the continued closure of the Feather River Hospital after the Camp  Fire  resulted  in  a  17%  reduction  in  the  total number of staffed beds in Butte County. While the patient demand  for  hospitals  increased  due  to  the  loss  of  100 staffed  beds  because  of  damage  on  healthcare  facilities. The  challenges  are  exacerbated  when  pandemics  are combined  with  natural  disasters,  especially  if  the  natural disaster  has  a  relatively  short  return  period,  such  as tsunami  and  earthquake.  The  occurrence  of  both  events concurrently  or  spatially  over  time  can  have  disastrous consequences  for  community  infrastructure,  social,  and economic  institutions,  necessitating  prompt  and  timely prevention and control measures. Healthcare  systems,  in  particular,  play  a  critical  role in  minimizing  losses  and  saving  as  many  lives  as possible.  When  both  events  occur,  managing  healthcare systems  may  be  difficult  due  to  the  various  conflicting mitigation  strategies  required  for  each  event  separately. (Hassan & Mahmoud 2021, Kouadio et al 2012). 
Conclusions Dual  disasters  are inevitable,  and  they  require versatile  tools  to  estimate  the  potential  impacts  of disasters  on  pandemic  mitigation.  The  SIR  model  is  one versatile  tool  that  can  assess  how  the  loss  of  healthcare systems  and functionality  due to  disasters  can significantly reduce the number  of COVID-19 cases that can  be  managed.  This  situation  becomes  more  severe when  dealing  with  the  COVID-19  Varian  that  has  high transmissibility,  including  the  latest  Omicron  B.1.1.529 Variant.
