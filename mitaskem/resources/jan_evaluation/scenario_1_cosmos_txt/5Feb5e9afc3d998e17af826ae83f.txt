1 Abstract
Our main aim is to estimate the last day for COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China. We developed mathematical models to predict reasonable bounds on the date of end of the COVID-19 epidemics in mainland China with strong quarantine and testing measures for a suﬃciently long time. We used reported data in China from January 20, 2020 to April 9, 2020. We ﬁrstly used a deterministic approach to obtain a formula to compute the probability distribution of the extinction date by combining the models and continuous-time Markov processes. Then we present the individual based model (IMB) simulations to compare the result by deterministic approach and show the absolute diﬀerence between the estimated cumulative probability distribution computed by simulations and formula. We provide the predictions of the last day of epidemic for diﬀerent fractions f of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic infectious.

3 Introduction
1
During the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, the government imposed strong intervention mea- sures such as enhanced epidemiological surveys and surveillance, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine. COVID-19 was brought under control in mainland China with these strong measures. Since March 12, the number of daily reported cases imported from mainland China has been kept within 5 for several weeks in mainland China. One of the most concerned issues now is the duration of the epidemic of ∗Corresponding authors.

COVID-19 in mainland China. However, there are several challenges to such analysis. COVID-19 can be contagious during the incubation period. The fraction of asymptomatic infectious cases and unre- ported cases (with mild symptom) and their contagiousness are of major importance in understanding the evolution of COVID-19 epidemic, and involves great diﬃculty in their estimation. As coronavirus outbreaks surge worldwide, more and more facts [11] show that many new patients which are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms can transmit the virus. Researches both in [12] and [4] have conﬁrmed that asymptomatic transmission occurs. It has been shown in [14] that some new crown pneumonia patients had higher viral levels in the throat swabs during the early stage of the disease. [10] reported that 13 evacuees from Wuhan, China on chartered ﬂights were infected, of whom 4, never developed symptoms and the estimated asymptomatic proportion in [3] is at 17.9%. A team in China [13] suggests that by February 18, there were 37,400 people with the virus in Wuhan whom authorities didn’t know about. Research in [5] estimates 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%- 90%]) prior to January 23, 2020 travel restrictions. The transmission rate of undocumented infections was 55% of documented infections ([46%-62%]). Due to their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases. The asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases were missed because authorities aren’t doing enough testing, or ’preclinical cases’ in which people are incubating the virus but would not be ill enough to seek medical help, would probably slip past screening methods such as temperature checks. The asymptomatic and unreported cases are just going to be really critical for explaining the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. In previous works [6, 7, 8], our team has developed diﬀerential equations models of COVID-19 epi- demics to predict forward in time the future number of cases from early reported case data in regions throughout the world. Our models of the COVID-19 epidemic incorporate the key features of this epi- demic: (1) the importance of the timing and magnitude of the implementation of major government public restrictions designed to mitigate the severity of the epidemic; (2) the importance of asymptomatic infectious, reported (with sever symptom) and unreported (with mild symptom) cases in interpreting the number of reported cases. This article is devoted to the duration of the epidemic of COVID-19 in mainland China. The duration of the stochastic epidemic has been considered in the 70th by Barbour [1]. We refer Britton and Pardoux [2] for more results about stochastic epidemic models. Our goal in the present paper is to investigate the duration of the epidemic of COVID-19 in mainland China in function of the fraction of unreported cases.
4 Method
(4.1)
4.1 Data
We use the cumulative data of the reported cases conﬁrmed by testing in mainland China from January 20, 2020 to March 18, 2020, taken from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China and Chinese center for disease control and prevention [15, 16]. We should note the following fact: Before February 11, the cumulative data of the reported cases was conﬁrmed by testing. From February 11, the cumulative data included cases that were not tested for the virus, but were clinically diagnosed based on medical imaging. The cumulative data from February 10 to February 15 speciﬁed both types of reported cases. But from February 16, the data did not separate the two types of reporting, but reported the sum of both types which makes it impossible for us to know the number of cases tested. There were total 17,409 clinically diagnosed cases from February 10 to February 15. We subtracted 17,409 cases from the cumulative reported cases after February 15 to obtain the approximate data by testing only after February 15 as shown in Table 1 with this adjustment. Note that on January 23rd 2020 mainland China started the lock-down of Wuhan city, and implemented other interventions soon on other Chinese cities.

4.2 The model
The model consists of the following system of ordinary diﬀerential equations: 
S(cid:48)(t) = −τ (t)S(t)[I(t) + U (t)], I(cid:48)(t) = τ (t)S(t)[I(t) + U (t)] − νI(t), R(cid:48)(t) = ν1I(t) − ηR(t),  U(cid:48)(t) = ν2I(t) − ηU (t),

with initial data
(4.2) S(t0) = S0 > 0, I(t0) = I0 > 0, R(t0) = R0 ≥ 0 and U (t0) = U0 ≥ 0.
Here t ≥ t0 is time in days, t0 is the beginning date of the model of the epidemic, S(t) is the number of individuals susceptible to infection at time t, I(t) is the number of asymptomatic infectious individuals at time t, R(t) is the number of reported symptomatic infectious individuals at time t, and U (t) is the number of unreported symptomatic infectious individuals at time t. The parameters and initial conditions of the model are given in Table 2 and a ﬂow diagram of the model is given in Figure 1. The transmission rate at time t is τ (t). Asymptomatic infectious individuals I(t) are infectious for an average period of 1/ν days. Reported symptomatic individuals R(t) are infectious for an average period of 1/η days, as are unreported symptomatic individuals U (t). We assume that reported symptomatic infectious individuals R(t) are reported and isolated immediately, and cause no further infections. The asymptomatic individuals I(t) can also be viewed as having a low-level symptomatic state. All infections are acquired from either I(t) or U (t) individuals. The fraction f of asymptomatic infectious become reported symptomatic infectious, and the fraction 1 − f become unreported symptomatic infectious. The rate asymptomatic infectious become reported symptomatic is ν1 = f ν, the rate asymptomatic infectious become unreported symptomatic is ν2 = (1 − f ) ν, where ν1 + ν2 = ν. During the exponential growth phase τ (t) ≡ τ0 is constant. We then use a time-dependent decreasing transmission rate τ (t) to incorporate the eﬀects of the strong measures taken by the authorities to control the epidemics (conﬁnement, contact tracing, etc...). The formula for τ (t) is (cid:40)
(4.3)
(cid:40) τ (t) = τ0, 0 ≤ t ≤ N, τ (t) = τ0 exp (−µ (t − N )) , N < t.
(4.4)
The date N and the value of µ are chosen so that the cumulative reported cases in the numerical simulation of the epidemic aligns with the cumulative reported case data after day N, when the public measures take eﬀect. In this way we are able to project forward the time-path of the epidemic after the government-imposed public restrictions take eﬀect. The cumulative number of reported cases at time t is given by the formula (cid:90) t
(cid:90) t CR(t) = ν1 I(σ)dσ, for t ≥ t0, t0 (cid:90) t
(4.5)
(cid:90) t CU (t) = ν2 I(σ)dσ, for t ≥ t0. t0
and the cumulative number of unreported at time t is given by the formula (cid:90) t
The daily number of reported cases from the model can be obtained by computing the solution of the following equation:
(cid:48) (4.6) DR (t) = ν f I(t) − DR(t), for t ≥ t0 and DR(t0) = DR0.
4.3 Method to estimate the parameters and initial values of the model
The actual value of f is unknown. Because of the strong isolation and testing measures in China, it seems reasonable to take f = 0.8 which means that 80% of symptomatic infectious cases go reported. We will however test diﬀerent values 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 of f. We assume η = 1/7, which means that the average period of infectiousness of both unreported symptomatic infectious individuals and reported symptomatic infectious individuals is 7 days. We assume ν = 1/7, which means that the average period of infectiousness of asymptomatic infectious individuals is 7 days. These values can be modiﬁed as further epidemiological information becomes known. For the exponential growth of reported cumulative cases CR(t) of the COVID-19 epidemic, we propose a formula: (4.7) CR(t) = χ1 exp(χ2 t) − χ3, t ≥ t0.

CR(t) = χ1 exp(χ2 t) − χ3, t ≥ t0. We ﬁx the value of χ3. The values of χ1 and χ2 are ﬁtted to the cumulative reported case data in the exponential growth phase of the epidemic (i.e. we use an exponential ﬁt χ1 exp(χ2 t) to ﬁt the data CR(t) + 1). We assume that the initial value S0 corresponds to the population of the region of the

reported case data. The value of the susceptible population S(t) is assumed to be only slightly changed by the removal of the number of people infected in the beginning of the exponential growth phase. The following formulas for I0, U0, t0, τ0, and R0 were derived in [6]. Their numerical values are identiﬁed by using (4.8) from the exponential growth phase of the epidemic. The other initial conditions are (cid:19) (cid:18) (1 − f )(ν1 + ν2)
(cid:19) χ2 (4.8) (cid:18) (1 − f )(ν1 + ν2) I0 = , U0 = I0, R0 = 0. f (ν1 + ν2) η + χ2

5.1 Derivation of a formula to compute the last day the outbreak In order to estimate the parameters and initial values of the model, we ﬁrstly ﬁx the value χ3 = 30. The values of χ1 and χ2 in χ1 exp(χ2 t)− χ3 are ﬁtted to the cumulative reported case data from January 19 to January 26 in Table 1 for mainland China when it is recognized that CR(t) is growing exponentially. The values of the parameter τ0 and initial conditions I0, U0, R0,and t0 are obtained by using formula (4.8)-(4.10). We summarize all the results when f takes diﬀerent values 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 in Table 3. Using the mathematical model (4.1) with parameters and initial values in Table 3, we project the future daily data of reported cases and cumulative data of cases, both reported and unreported for mainland China. In Figures 4 and 5, we present the comparison of the model with the cumulative and daily data for mainland China, respectively. The transmission τ (t) is decreasing exponentially fast for t > N. Therefore, if we choose a day t1 (suﬃciently long after the turning point the quantity τ (t)S(t) ≤ τ (t)S0 is small enough) so we can use the approximation (cid:48) I (t) (cid:39) −νI(t). for I-equation in system (4.1). This means that the ﬂux of newly infectious can be neglected after the day t1. We illustrate S0τ (t) in Figure 2 for a typical case. If we assume that this approximation does not inﬂuence signiﬁcantly the number of infectious after the day t1, we can take τ (t) = 0 in the original model (4.1) and for t ≥ t1 the resulting system is the following (cid:48) (t) = −νI(t), (cid:48) (5.1) R (t) = ν1 I(t) − ηR(t), (cid:48) I U (t) = ν2 I(t) − ηU (t). This system is supplemented by the initial data

I(t1) = I1, U (t1) = U1 and R(t1) = R1.
where I1, U1 and R1 are the values of the solutions of the original system (4.1)-(4.2) on day t1. The ﬂux diagram of model (5.1) is described in Figure 3.

In Figure 6 we represent the error between the solution of (4.1) and the solution of (5.1) for t > t1 by computing the error as follows. max(cid:0) (cid:1),
max(cid:0) err(t1) = sup |I(t) − I1(t)|,|U (t) − U1(t)| t≥t1
(5.3) (cid:1), |I(t) − I1(t)|,|U (t) − U1(t)|
where I(t) and U (t) are solution of system (4.1) and I1(t) and U1(t) are solution of system (4.4). This error formula does not involve the component R(t) for reported cases, because this component is supposed to be known. In Section 7, we use model (5.1) to compute the probability that no I-individual (no asymptomatic infectious) and no U-individual (symptomatic unreported) are left after the day t. We obtain that there are no more unreported case after the day t with the probability (cid:16) (cid:16) −η(t−t1)(cid:17)I1 −η(t−t1)(cid:17)U1
P(I(s) + U (s) = 0 for s ≥ t| I(t1) = I1, U (t1) = U1) (cid:16) (cid:16) −η(t−t1)(cid:17)I1 −η(t−t1)(cid:17)U1 (5.4) . = × 1 − e −ν(t−t1) − (1 − f )ν(t − t1)e 1 − e
Formula (5.4) allows us to compute the probability of the date of extinction according to the values of I(t1) and U (t1) for diﬀerent t1 when η = ν. (I(t1), U (t1)) is the value of the solution of (4.1) at t1 with the parameters and initial values taken from Table 3. We show the results in Figure 7. Observe that, as t1 increases, the probability distribution of the date of extinction seems to converge to a limit proﬁle. Furthermore, we could also compute 90%, 95% and 99% probability of the date of extinction for diﬀerent values of f by formula (5.4) when η = ν. In fact, the parameters and initial values in model (4.1) were taken from Table 3 for each value of f. Then we compute the values of I(t1) and U (t1) for diﬀerent values of t1 which is the value of the solution of (4.1) at t1. Thus we could compute 90%, 95% and 99% probability of the date of extinction according to the values of I(t1) and U (t1) for diﬀerent values of t1 which was summarized in Figure 8.
5.2 Stochastic simulations of (4.1) and comparison with (5.4)
To get insight on the variability caused by the randomness of the epidemiological transitions (trans- mission of the disease due to a contact between an infected and a susceptible, development of symptoms, recovery or death) we developed an individual based model (IMB) in which those epidemiological transi- tions are modeled by random variables following exponential laws, as described in the ﬂowchart (Figure 3). The interest of these simulations is mostly twofold:
• To estimate the evolution of the epidemic when the accurate number of each class of infected is known. In practice we estimate those numbers by using the deterministic model (4.1) using the available data.
• To give numerical estimates of the cumulative probability distribution of the date of end of the epidemic, without the assumption that τ = 0 used in equation (4.1).
In Figure 9, we plot the cumulative distribution for the probability extinction of the epidemic of COVID- 19 obtained by the individual-based simulations. The parameter t1 in Figure 9 is the date at which the stochastic simulations are started; the precise initial condition is the solution to (4.1) at time t1. In other words we follow the deterministic model (4.1) up to the date t1, then start the stochastic simulations. The fact that all curves seem to be superimposed with one another indicates that the cumulative probability distribution of the extinction date does not depend on the starting point of the simulations. We also observe that the unique distribution given by the individual-based simulations coincides with the limiting proﬁle for the cumulative distribution in Figure 7. This validates our assumption that τ (t) can be identiﬁed to 0 to compute the cumulative distribution of the extinction date when t1 is chosen suﬃciently large. We infer from Figure 7 that this approximation is acceptable when t1 is larger than Feb. 17. To be more precise on the relevance of the approximation formula (5.4), we computed the absolute value of the diﬀerence between the cumulative distribution of the extinction date given by (5.4) and the one given by stochastic simulations in Table 4. More precisely, we computed the quantity

for each t1 presented in Figures 7 and 9, where fIBM is the cumulative distribution computed by stochastic simulations (Figure 9) and fformula is the cumulative distribution given by (5.4) (Figure 7). Finally, we compared the results of the individual based model simulations starting from the to the result of the model (4.1). The plots of the average value over our individual-based simulations compared to the corresponding component of the model (4.1) are presented in Figure 10. In Figure 11 we present a representation of the average and standard deviation of the populations computed by the individual- based simulations. Note however that the high variability observed is largely due to the small size of the initial population at t0. In Table 6 we show that this variability diminishes when the starting time of the stochastic simulations increases.
6 Discussion
In this study we mixed the deterministic approach, which correctly describes the initial and interme- diate phases of the epidemics, with individual-based models which give estimates on the real extinction date of the epidemics. In Table 7 we summarize our ﬁndings for f = 0.8, 0.6, 0.4 and 0.2. From this table we deduce that the larger f is the earlier the epidemic will stop. Therefore it is very important to increase as much as possible the value of f in order to reduce the duration of the epidemic of COVID-19 in mainland China. We developed a mathematical framework to predict reasonable bounds on the date of end of the COVID-19 epidemics in mainland China, provided quarantine and conﬁnement measures are maintained with suﬃcient strength. In particular, the day at which conﬁnement was eased is nowhere near any reasonable bound for the extinction date. Therefore, a secondary outbreak in mainland China is not to be discarded: there is a high probability that there still exists a signiﬁcant number of unreported infected individuals in the population. Many parameters are still unknown concerning the future behavior of the pandemics. For what concerns mainland China, if the remaining hidden number of infected individuals can be estimated by our models, the transmission rate after the end of the conﬁnement measures remains unknown. Indeed, it is reasonable to expect that sociological phenomena like the awareness of the danger have a strong impact on this quantity, because people will tend to avoid risky behavior. There is a strong incentive to identify quantitatively this transmission rate after the end of conﬁnement measures, as we believe that this parameter is crucial to determine whether the epidemic will potentially start again or not. This issue will be addressed in a forthcoming paper. In this article we computed the end day of the epidemic by neglecting the fact that Chinese people went back to work. Here we basically assume that the new distancing measures were good enough to avoid new case after the end of February. Actually people in China went back to work gradually starting from February 10th and until now the school and university are still closed. This kind issues can lead to new developments and are left for future work.

7.1 Formula to compute the probability distribution of the extinction date
We use continuous-time Markov processes to compute the exact distribution of the date of end of the epidemic after the transmission rate is eﬀectively taken as zero. We start on t1 with initial values I1, U1, and R1 for I-individuals, U-individuals and R-individuals, respectively. The evolution of each individual is guided by independent exponential processes, and we have the following:
(i) Each individual I will change state following an exponential clock of rate ν. When I changes its state, it will be transferred to the class of R-individuals with probability f and to the class of U-individuals with probability (1 − f );
6
U-individuals with probability (1 − f ); (ii) Each individual in the state U will change state following an exponential clock with rate η and become removed individual;
(iii) Each individual in the state R will change state following an exponential clock with rate η and become removed individual

Since the class I has only outgoing ﬂuxes, the law of extinction for the I-individuals is (cid:19)I1 (cid:18)(cid:90) t (cid:16) −ν(t−t1)(cid:17)I1
(cid:19)I1 (cid:18)(cid:90) t (cid:16) −ν(t−t1)(cid:17)I1 νe −ν(s−t1)ds = , 1 − e P(I(t) = 0| I(t1) = I1) = t1
and the probability to have some I-individual left at time t is −ν(t−t1))I1−I e
−ν(t−t1))I1−I e −νI(t−t1). P(I(t) = I | I(t1) = I1) = (1 − e
P(I(t) = I | I(t1) = I1) = (1 − e For the U-individuals and the R-individuals, the situation is more intricate. Indeed, the U-individuals and the R-individuals vanish at a constant rate η but new individuals appear from the I class at rate (1 − f )ν and f ν, respectively, depending on the remaining stock of I. Therefore the probability that U gets extinct before t also depends on the number of remaining I. It is actually easier to compute directly the extinction property for the sum I + U, which is our aim anyways. When ν (cid:54)= η, we obtain (cid:19)I1 (cid:18)(cid:90) t

7.2 Cumulative distribution of the date of end of the epidemic
The stochastic simulations introduced in section 5.2 can be used, in particular, to precisely estimate the cumulative probability distribution of the date of end of the epidemic, deﬁned as the last time at which the quantity I + U is positive. In order to get a measure of the precision we remark that the values taken by the cumulative proba- bility distribution f (t) can be estimated by the average of independent measures of the random variable
X = 1text≤t,

(cid:1) ε2 ln(cid:0) α 2 and we achieved an error of at most ε = 10−3 at risk α ≤ 10−3 by running n = − 2 ≈ 15201805 independent individual-based simulations to estimate the probability distribution of the extinction time (Figure 9, t1 = 82 i.e. March 23). Other curves are esimated on the basis of 152019 independent simulations, which amouts to an error of at most 10−2 at risk 10−3. Since the curves presented in Figure 7 are so similar that it is diﬃcult to see any diﬀerence between them, we computed the absolute error between each curve and the “reference” of t1 = 82. We present the numerical values in Table 5. Notice that the error is actually below the estimated precision of the approximation.

Figure 9: Estimated cumulative probability distributions of the extinction date of the epidemic for diﬀerent values of the starting point of the stochastic simulations. The red curve is the cumulative distribution corresponding to initial conditions started at t1 = 82 (March 23). The initial conditions were computed by rounding the solution to (4.1) at t = t1 to the nearest integer. The red curve is estimated with an error of at most 10−3 at risk 10−3 and other curves are estimated with an error of at most 10−2 at a risk of 10−3. We took f = 0.8 and other parameter values are shown in Table 3.
