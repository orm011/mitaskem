Abstract
The severe shortfall in testing supplies during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing struggle to control disease spread have aﬃrmed the need to plan rigorous optimized supply-constrained resource allocation strategies for the next inevitable novel disease epidemic. To address the challenge of optimizing limited resource usage in the face of complicated disease dynamics, we develop an integro partial diﬀerential equation disease model which incorporates realistic latent, incubation, and infectious period distributions along with limited testing supplies for identifying and quarantining infected individuals, and we analyze the inﬂuence of these ele- ments on controllability and optimal resource allocation between two testing strategies, ‘clinical’ targeting symptomatic individuals and ‘non-clinical’ targeting non-symptomatic individuals, for reducing total infection sizes. We apply our model to not only the original, delta, and omicron COVID-19 variants, but also to generic diseases which have diﬀerent oﬀsets between latent and incubation period distributions which allow for or prevent varying degrees of presymptomatic transmission or preinfectiousness symptom onset. We ﬁnd that factors which reduce control- lability generally call for reduced levels of non-clinical testing, while the relationship between symptom onset, controllability, and optimal strategies is complicated. Although greater degrees of presymptomatic transmission reduce disease controllability, they may enhance or reduce the role of non-clinical testing in optimal strategies depending on other disease factors like overall transmissibility and latent period length. Our model allows a spectrum of diseases to be com- pared under the same lens such that the lessons learned from COVID-19 can be adapted to resource constraints in the next emerging epidemic and analyzed for optimal strategies under a consistent mathematical framework.
1 Introduction
Since its declaration as a global pandemic in March 2020 (1), COVID-19 has caused over 600
million cumulative infections and 6 million deaths (2). This loss of life and productivity together
with ubiquitous lockdowns and mobility restrictions have resulted in devastating socioeconomic
consequences worldwide (3, 4). The particularly severe costs of lockdowns underscore the need for
eﬀective large scale test-trace-quarantine programs to combat emerging disease epidemics and save

lives while keeping society open and functioning. Unfortunately, for an emerging epidemic caused by a novel pathogen, testing supplies and health care infrastructure may be inadequate to meet de- mand as health agencies struggle to implement new techniques and technologies at population-wide scales. During the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, testing capacities fell well-short of the levels required to monitor populations and test all suspected cases, while delays due to processing backlogs limited the usefulness of the small number of tests that were actually available (5, 6). Even now, 3 years after the emergence of COVID-19, supplies have struggled to meet the demand of case surges associated with new COVID variants (6). When COVID resources have fallen short of demand, experts and health agencies have rec- ommended the prioritization of testing supplies to the most severely symptomatic and vulnerable patients most typically found in clinical health care settings, rather than to non-clinical cases asso- ciated with mildly or asymptomatic individuals and population monitoring programs (6, 7, 8). This strategy seeks to maximize the utility of the few resources available by limiting the amount ‘wasted’ on individuals who are not infected, but in the process excludes the possibility of slowing disease spread by identifying and quarantining non-symptomatic infected individuals (9). Achieving an ideal balance between clinical and non-clinical resource allocation is especially pertinent for a dis- ease like COVID-19, where undetected presymptomatic transmission caused by mismatched latent and incubation periods (10, 11) as well as potentially large numbers of undetected totally asymp- tomatic spreaders (12, 13, 14, 15) present signiﬁcant barriers to controllability. Given the complexity of real-world disease dynamics with features like presymptomatic transmission and symptom-based interventions, simpliﬁed compartmental mathematical models provide powerful tools for analyzing and optimizing control strategies in the face of resource limitations. Many previous compartmental models have been developed to analyze and optimize COVID-19 control strategies like testing and quarantine. Generally, models handle presymptomatic transmis- sion by one of two broad schemes. One class of models simply ignores the potential for presymp- tomatic transmission by having infected individuals transition from an exposed non-symptomatic non-infectious compartment to an infectious symptomatic compartment, often with an additional infection channel comprised of permanently asymptomatic infected individuals. Such models have been used to analyze testing, contact tracing, and quarantine control strategies (16, 17), particu- larly in the context of limited resource constraints (18), along with vaccination control (19) and

non-pharmaceutical interventions like masking and social distancing (20, 21). Although useful as simple baseline examples, these models may overestimate the eﬃcacy of symptom-based COVID- 19 controls due to the absence of presymptomatic transmission. Another class of models includes a presymptomatic compartment where individuals are infectious but not yet symptomatic before transitioning to an infectious symptomatic class (22, 23, 24, 25). This approach, although more realistic, presents challenges when interpreting results for real world decision making via compar- isons to the simpler class of models. Speciﬁcally, when multiple infectious stages are incorporated in an ordinary diﬀerential equation model, the total infectious period is no longer exponentially dis- tributed (as occurs for a single infectious stage), but is instead more similar to a gamma or Wielbul distribution (26), and such non-exponential distributions have been shown to be more diﬃcult to control with identiﬁcation-isolation strategies as compared to exponential distributions (27). Thus, it is unclear if diﬀerences in output between models with presymptomatic compartments and that of simpler models are due to presymptomatic transmission or to non-exponential infectious peri- ods, and this presents a barrier to interpreting model results for real-world decision making. Of further complication, when a totally asymptomatic infection channel is included, one must either add a ﬁctitious presymptomatic compartment for this class or accept a major qualitative diﬀerence between the never symptomatic and eventually symptomatic infectious period distributions (ex- ponential vs non-exponential). Finally, this class of models can not be adapted to other diseases for which infectiousness peaks well after symptom onset (such as with the 2003 SARS coronavirus (28, 29)) without signiﬁcant changes to model structure, and this complicates any comparative mathematical analysis of diseases which are fundamentally similar to one another aside changes in the oﬀset between their incubation and latent period. This deﬁcit may be particularly problematic for using mathematical models to inform real-world control strategies for new emerging epidemics based on the lessons learned from COVID-19.
3
We address these shortcomings by developing a partial integro diﬀerential equation model which utilizes the age of infection to decouple symptom status from speciﬁc model compartments. Our model is general in its ability to incorporate any latent, incubation, and infectious period distri- bution, regardless of shape or relative timings of means, and is utilized to analyze the original, delta, and omicron variants as well as a spectrum of other generic diseases all under a single lens. We incorporate a testing and quarantine control strategy which uses testing resources to identify

infected individuals and remove them from the population, accounting for factors like contact trac- ing, limited population accessibility, and biases towards test-positive results. Our control assumes a ﬁxed maximum testing capacity which must be allocated between clinical testing targeted at symptomatic individuals and non-clinical testing targeted at pre and asymptomatic individuals, and we analyze how controllability and optimal allocation strategies for reducing total infection size and behave as functions of resource availability, testing quality, and disease characteristics. In general, we ﬁnd that most factors which reduce controllability also call for a smaller share of resources to be devoted to non-clinical testing. However, although presymptomatic transmission is found to reduce controllability, whether or not it reduces the role of non-clinical testing depends on a complicated relationship between latent-incubation oﬀset, disease transmissibility, and latent period length. In particular, we ﬁnd that diseases which lack presymptomatic transmission do not necessarily call for a reduction in non-clinical testing compared to diseases with presymptomatic transmission. Together, these results highlight how intuition for disease control strategies based on qualitative disease characteristics may fail and emphasize the need for mathematical modeling in order to prepare for future epidemics.
2 Methods
We extend the previous ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE) SEIR testing and quarantine model of Calabrese and Demers (18) to a system of integro-partial diﬀerential equations (IPDE) which explicitly incorporate the age of infection for infected classes. While our primary focus is COVID- 19, including the orginal, delta, and omicron variants, our system is general in its ability to account for any set of latent, incubation, and infectiousness periods.
2.1 Model outline
2.1.1 Uncontrolled transmission model
4
We assume a homogeneously mixed system of N total susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered individuals. Exposed and infectious classes are partitioned into those who will remain permanently asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection and those who will eventually become symp- tomatic at some point before recovery. Here, we take “asymptomatic” to mean genuinely exhibiting

no symptoms or exhibiting symptoms so minor that one would not typically consider themselves ill or seek medical attention, and “symptomatic” to mean exhibiting visually identiﬁable symptoms with moderate to critical illness. Upon infection, initially susceptible individuals S will enter either the exposed permanently asymptomatic class EA or the exposed eventually symptomatic class EY with probabilities fA and fY , respectively. While in an exposed class, individuals are infected but not yet infectious and are thus unable to transmit the disease to others. To account for the possibil- ity of non-exponential waiting times between infection sages, we continuously index exposed classes with the age of infection x. The number of individuals in the exposed permanently asymptomatic class at time t who have been infected for between x and x + dx units of time is denoted eA(t, x)dx such that the total number of exposed permanently asymptomatic individuals EA(t) is given by EA(t) =(cid:82) ∞ 0 dx eA(t, x). The age of infection-indexed exposed eventually symptomatic class eY (t, x) is deﬁned analogously. Permanently asymptomatic and eventually symptomatic exposed individ- uals with infection age x transition to their respective infectious classes a(t, x) and y(t, x) at rate ε(x). Infectious individuals enter into the recovered class R where they are no longer infectious and are assumed to attain permanent immunity at age of infection dependent recovery rate r(x). Although there is some evidence suggesting that eventually symptomatic and permanently asymp- tomatic individuals recover from COVID-19 at diﬀerent rates, disease progression is asymptomatic individuals is poorly understood, and conﬂicting studies have shown faster, similar, and slower viral clearance rates in asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases (30, 31). We therefore, for simplicity, take r(x) to be equivalent for permanently asymptomatic and eventually symptomatic infections. Likewise, we are aware of only one study suggesting diﬀerent transitions rates from the exposed to infectious class for permanently asymptomatic versus eventually symptomatic individuals (10), but the corresponding average waiting times diﬀer by only 1 part in 20, so we assume exposed to infectious transitions rates to be independent of the eventual presence or lack of symptoms. The dynamical equations for the uncontrolled transmission model are as follows:

In the above equations, overdots denote ordinary derivatives with respect to time t, β denotes the average number of contacts made per unit time by an individual, N is the total population size, and λA and λY denote the transmission probability per susceptible-infectious contact for the never symptomatic and eventually symptomatic classes, respectively (for simplicity, we assume transmission probability to be independent of the age of infection). The boundary terms eA(t, 0) and eY (t, 0) denote the rates of newly generated infections and thus represent to individuals with infection age x = 0. The boundary terms a(t, 0) and y(t, 0) are zero due to the fact that every infected individual will spend at least some time in an exposed class before becoming infectious and will therefore never enter an infectious class with an infection age x = 0. The integrals in Eq. (1k) relate the total number of individuals in an infected class to the corresponding distribution over the age of infection.
2.1.2 Symptom onset
6
The model in Eq. (1) makes no assumptions regarding the onset of symptoms in infected individuals. This modeling choice is based on the fact that the natural dynamics of disease transmission (absent of interventions or controls explicitly correlated with symptom status) depend fundamentally on infectious states rather than symptom states. In our IPDE model, symptoms are an incidental

background state which need not be represented by separate pre and post symptom onset com- partments for each infected compartment as would be required in an ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE) model. We utilize the age of infection in the eventually symptomatic classes to the deﬁne the symptomatic population XS(t) by the following integral: (cid:90) ∞ (cid:16) (cid:17)
(cid:90) ∞ (cid:16) (cid:17) dx . (2) Pe(x)eY (t, x) + Py(x)y(t, x) XS(t) = 0
The functions Pe(x) and Py(x) denote the respective probabilities for exposed and infectious in- dividuals to show symptoms by infection day x. These probabilities likewise determine the non- symptomatic infected population XN (t) as follows: (cid:90) ∞ (cid:17) (cid:16)(cid:0)1 − Pe(x)(cid:1)eY (t, x) +(cid:0)1 − Py(x)(cid:1)y(t, x)
(cid:90) ∞ (cid:17) dx . (3) XN (t) = EA(t) + A(t) + (cid:16)(cid:0)1 − Pe(x)(cid:1)eY (t, x) +(cid:0)1 − Py(x)(cid:1)y(t, x) 0
The non-symptomatic infected population is comprised of all never-symptomatic infected individ- uals plus the eventually symptomatic infected individuals who are not yet showing symptoms. In our simulations, we consider two assumptions for Pe(x) and Py(x), “correlated symptoms” and “incubation symptoms:”
Correlated Symptoms: (4) Pe(x) = 0, Py(x) = 1. Incubation Symptoms: Pe(x) = Py(x) =(cid:82) x 0 dx(cid:48)fI (x(cid:48)).
The correlated symptoms assumption deﬁnes symptom onset to occur in perfect correlation with infectiousness onset. Here, there is no possibility of pre-symptomatic transmission or pre-infectious symptom onset, and the symptomatic population is the entire eventually symptomatic infectious class. This assumption is equivalent to the symptom assumptions of our previous ODE testing and quarantine COVID-19 model in (18). The incubation symptoms assumptions deﬁnes Pe(x) and Py(x) to be the cumulative distribution function of an incubation period distribution fI (x). Here, fI (x)dx denotes the probability for an eventually symptomatic individual to begin showing symptoms between age of infection x and x + dx. The ﬂow diagram in Fig. 1 summarizes the progression of infectious and symptomatic states in the uncontrolled transmission model.

Figure 1: Schematic indicating the ﬂow of infectious and symptomatic states in our uncontrolled transmission. Upon infection, susceptible individuals S move into either the never symptomatic exposed class EA or the eventually symptomatic exposed class EY with an initial age of infection x = 0. As individuals linger in the exposed classes, their ages of infection increase, and transitions to the never symptomatic infectious A and eventually symptomatic infectious Y occur at infection age dependent transition rate ε(x) Infectious individuals then transition to the recovered class R at infection age dependent transition rate r(x). Symptom status appears as background state indicated by the red an green boxes. For eventually symptomatic exposed and infectious individuals with infection age x, a fraction Pe(x) and Py(x), respectively, will be in the symptomatic state XS, while the remaining fractions 1−Pe(x) and 1−Py(x) will be in the non-symptomatic state XN . The never symptomatic classes EA and A are permanently asymptomatic and remain in the non-symptomatic state XN until recovery.

2.1.3 Testing and quarantine transmission model
We adapt the resource allocation testing and quarantine control framework from the ODE model of (18) to our IPDE disease model. Testing identiﬁes and transfers infected individuals to a quarantine class Q where they remain isolated from contacts until recovery and are unable to generate new transmissions. We assume a ﬁnite testing resource represented by the testing capacity C, deﬁned as the maximum per capita number of tests able to be administered and processed per day. A fraction ρ of the testing capacity is allocated to non-clinical testing for identifying non-symptomatic infected individuals, while the remaining fraction 1− ρ is allocated to clinical testing for identifying symptomatic infected individuals. Clinical testing is conducted only at hospitals and medical centers speciﬁcally for those showing visually identiﬁable symptoms, while non-clinical testing is accessible to the general public. The actual rate at which tests are administered and processed for the two testing categories is dependent on the testing demand, i.e. to the number of people eligible for and actively seeking testing. Here, we provide the functional forms of test administration and processing rates for clinical and non-clinical testing and sketch the reasoning behind their formulation. Further details are elucidated in (18). The average time required for a non-clinical test to be administered and processed for a single individual is denoted τN such that the average administration and processing rate is given by 1/τN : 0,
C = 0 or ρ = 0 (5) τ−1 N = (cid:21)−1 (cid:20) XN (t)+(cid:0)1−η(cid:1)(cid:0)S(t)+U (t)(cid:1) , otherwise τ + κ ρCN 0,
Non-clinical testing enters the disease model by transferring a fraction κ of the never symptomatic and eventually symptomatic not yet showing symptoms populations to the quarantined class Q at rate τ−1 N . The case C = 0 corresponds to no testing capacity and thus no control, while the case ρ = 0 corresponds to all resources being devoted to clinical testing which reduces the non-clinical testing rate to zero. The quantity τ is the intrinsic testing time, deﬁned as average time required for an individual get to a testing center, get tested, and receive results absent of delays or backlogs due to other patents. We take this value to be equal to one day. The testing demand for non-clinical testing is deﬁned as a fraction κ the non-symptomatic population XN (t) in Eq. (3) as well as a fraction κ(1 − η) of the uninfected population S(t) + U (t). Here, U (t) represents individuals who

were previously infected and subsequently recovered without being tested and are thus unaware that they have immunity (we assume recovered individuals who were tested and quarantined know that they have immunity and therefore exclude themselves from future testing). The accessibility parameter κ ∈ (0, 1] represents the fraction of the total population open to and compliant with non- clinical testing, and the concentration parameter η ∈ [0, 1) represents the degree to which testing is focused on or biased towards infected individuals. A purely random population monitoring program which reaches all members of the population corresponds to κ = 1 and η = 0. Any factor which inﬂuences a given test will be more likely applied to an infected individual as compared to purely random sampling will increase η. For example, those who suspect a recent disease exposure may be both more likely to seek testing and more likely to test positive compared a randomly selected individual, and this inﬂuence will focus testing towards the XN population and away from the S +U population. Likewise, a highly eﬀective contact tracing program may result in a relatively large value of η, but there may be many individuals unwilling to participate in government or health agency eﬀorts, so the corresponding value of κ may be relatively small. Generally, the diﬀering behavioral characteristics of individuals and diﬀering testing policies of local governments unique to diﬀering regions will correspond to a variety of concentration and accessibility levels, so we will analyze model results for a wide array of κ and η values. The analysis in (18) shows that η can be estimated from data comparing test-positive to disease prevalence rates, and that η = 0.95 is an upper bound on optimistically achievable values. The average time required for a clinical test to be administered and processed for a single symptomatic individual is denoted τC such that the average administration and processing rate is given by 1/τC: 0,
C = 0 or ρ = 1 (6) τ−1 C = (cid:105)−1 (cid:104) , otherwise τ + XS (t) 0, (1−ρ)CN
Clinical testing enters the disease model by transferring symptomatic individuals to the quarantine class Q at rate τ−1 C . The case C = 0 corresponds to no control, while the case ρ = 1 corresponds to all resources being devoted to non-clinical testing which reduces the clinical testing rate to zero. In contrast to non-clinical testing, clinical testing is assumed to have full concentration on and

full accessibility to the target infected population, meaning that the testing demand is comprised only of the symptomatic population XS and includes no uninfected individuals. We base this on the assumption that all individuals in the eventually symptomatic classes who are currently showing symptoms are all ill enough to seek medical attentions (full advisability), and that due to the presence of strong visually identiﬁable symptoms and the lack of secondary diseases in our model, there is no chance of using a clinically allocated test on an uninfected individual (full concentration). In this sense, clinical testing acts as a veriﬁcation tool, while non-clinical testing acts as an identiﬁcation tool.
For both testing types, when testing demand is very low, tests are administered and processed at maximum rates τ−1 C ≈ τ−1 and τ−1 N ≈ τ−1 per individual, and the total number of clinical tests conducted per day grows linearly with the size of the symptomatic population. As demand increases, supply limitations and patient backlogs cause τ−1 N to decrease towards zero, and C and τ−1 the total number of clinical and non-clinical tests conducted per day saturates to (1 − ρ)CN and ρCN ,respectively, as testing demand approaches inﬁnity. The full model equations with testing and quarantine control are given in Eq. (7) and a corresponding ﬂow diagram is given in Fig. 2. Table 1 summarizes the deﬁnitions of all control-related parameters.

2.1.4 Transition rates
The transition rates ε(x) and r(x) are determined by probability distributions for infection ages at which transitions between disease states occur. Speciﬁcally, letting fε(x) and denote the probability density for an infected individual to transition from exposed to infectious at infection age x, and letting fr(x) denote the probability density for an infectious individual transition to recovered at infection age x, the corresponding transition rates are deﬁned as follows: 1 −(cid:82) x
(8)
(9)
fε(x) ε(x) = , 1 −(cid:82) x 0 dx(cid:48) fε(x(cid:48)) fr(x) r(x) = . 1 −(cid:82) x 0 dx(cid:48) fr(x)
These transition rates represent conditional probability densities for an individual to transition to the next disease stage on infection day x given that they are still in the preceding disease stage up to day x. The probability densities for the infectious period duration and total infection duration, denoted finf (x) and ftot(x), respectively, can be written in terms of fε(x) and fr(x) as follows: (cid:90) ∞ 1 −(cid:82) s
(10)
(11)
(cid:90) ∞ fr(x + s) , ds fε(s) finf (x) = 1 −(cid:82) s 0 0 ds(cid:48) fr(s(cid:48)) (cid:90) x fr(x) . ftot(x) = ds fε(s) 1 −(cid:82) s 0 0 ds(cid:48) fr(s(cid:48))
To clarify, ftot(x)dx represents the probability for an newly infected individual to remain infected for a total duration between x and x + dx days, finf (x)dx represents the probability for that individual to be infectious (i.e. contagious) for a total duration between x and x + dx days over the course of their infection, and fr(x)dx represents the probability for that individual to recover between infection days x and x + dx given that they have already entered into an infectious state. If fr(x) is assumed to be an exponential distribution with mean 1/r, r(x) reduces to a constant r(x) = r while finf (x) becomes equivalent to fr(x). Likewise, if fε(x) is exponential with mean 1/ε, ε(x) reduces to a constant ε(x) = ε. If both fr(x) and fε(x) are exponential, ftot(x) becomes a two parameter hypoexponential distribution with parameters ε and r. The exponential distribution assumptions taken together with the correlated symptoms assumption in Sec. 2.1.2 reduce the IPDE testing and quarantine model in Eq. (7) to the ODE testing and quarantine model in (18).

2.2 Distribution and parameter values
2.2.1 COVID-19 variants
The distributions from which the transition rates ε(x) and r(x) are calculated, as well as the incu- bation period distribution, are based on epidemiological data for the original, delta, and omicron COVID-19 variants. The incubation period distribution fI (x) is a widely studied quantity for the early strains of COVID-19 which has been variously ﬁt to log-normal, gamma, or Weilbull distri- butions (32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37). The latent period distribution fε(x) and post-infectiousness onset recovery day distribution fr(x) are comparatively less well studied. For the original COVID-19 strain and delta variant, we utilize the results of Xin et al. (10) and Kang et al. (11), respectively, which estimate both fε and fI to be gamma distributions. We are aware of only one data-based study estimating the incubation period distribution for the omicron variant, Tanaka et al. (38), which ﬁts to a log-normal distribution with median 2.8 days, although other investigations esti- mating medians but not distributions have likewise obtained results approximately equal to 3 days (39, 40). To maintain consistency with the original and delta variants, we assume fI for omicron to be gamma distributed with mean and variance comparable to that of (38). We are unaware of any existing estimates for the omicron variant’s latent period distribution, so we assume a gamma distribution with mean 1.5 days shorter than that of the incubation period. For all variants, we are unaware of any studies which directly estimate the post-infectiousness onset recovery day distri- bution fr(x). However, viral culturing studies have consistently found live viral isolation to cease between 9 and 10 days post-symptom onset (30, 31, 41). We therefore assume a gamma distribution for fr(x) with mean (cid:104)fr(cid:105) = (cid:104)fI(cid:105) + 9.5 days for each variant, and we assume a scale parameter of 0.25 days to give tight distributions with relatively small interquartile ranges as indicted in (41). To assess the impact of the PDE elements of our model relative to the corresponding ODE model, we will compare simulation results under exponential and gamma distribution assumptions for fε and fr. Likewise, to assess the impact of pre-symptomatic transmission on disease controlla- bility, we will compare model results between the correlated symptoms and incubation symptoms assumptions in Eq. (4). The means (cid:104)fε(cid:105) are taken to be equivalent under the exponential and gamma assumptions, while we set (cid:104)fr(cid:105) = (cid:104)fI(cid:105) − (cid:104)fε(cid:105) + 9.5 days under the exponential assumption as compared to (cid:104)fr(cid:105) = (cid:104)fI(cid:105) + 9.5 days under the gamma assumption. This diﬀerence ensures that

the mean infectious period duration (cid:104)finf(cid:105) and mean total infection time (cid:104)ftot(cid:105) are essentially un- changed by the diﬀerent assumptions on fr. The means and standard deviations of fε, fr, and fI , as well as that of the resultant distributions finf and ftot, are given in Tables 2, 3, and 4 for the original, delta, and omicron COVID variants, respectively. Plots depicting the shapes of fε, fr, and fI for the three variants are given in Fig. 3. For all variants and distribution assumptions, the average infectious period is approximately 11 days while the average latent period is approximately 1.5 days shorter than the average incubation period, thus indicating an an average 1.5 day pre- symptomatic transmission window under the incubation symptoms assumption. The mean total infection duration decreases from the original to delta to omicron variant. The remaining model parameters and values are summarized in Table 5. For all COVID variants, the never-symptomatic and eventually-symptomatic population fractions, fA and fY , respectively, are highly uncertain parameters, as estimates based on both modeling and clinical data place fA anywhere from less than 1% to 90% (12, 13, 14, 15). Further, the value of fA will depend precisely on our deﬁnition of the diﬀerence between the moderate to critical symptoms exhibited by the eventually symptomatic class versus the mild to no symptoms exhibited by the never-symptomatic class. Evidence has suggested the majority of COVID cases to be mild (42, 43), so based on these observations, we choose fA = 0.75 and fY = 0.25. Likewise, the relative values of the never- symptomatic and eventually-symptomatic transmission probabilities, λA and λY , respectively, are highly uncertain. Various studies have show that non-symptomatic individuals are as, or less, in- fectious than symptomatic individuals (13, 14), and that greater symptom severity correlates with higher viral loads (13, 14, 42). Further, a study on the close contacts of index cases has suggested symptomatic individuals to be more infectious than asymptomatic individuals (44). We therefore assume λY = 2λA. To determine absolute values, we assume and average contact rate of β = 4 per day and scale λA such that the model’s uncontrolled basic reproduction number under the exponential distribution assumptions (i.e. equivalent ODE model), denoted Run 0 , matches values taken from the literature (see the Supplementary Section for a derivation and discussion of the basic reproduction number). In other words, we deﬁne the following quantity:
(12)
βλY βλA , Run + (1 − fA) 0 = fA r r

and then choose λA such that the above expression matches values for the diﬀerent COVID variants, where the values of fA and β are assumed, 1/r is equal to (cid:104)finf(cid:105) under the exponential distributions
where the values of fA and β are assumed, 1/r is equal to (cid:104)finf(cid:105) under the exponential distributions
assumptions in Tables 2, 3, or 4, and where we assume λY = 2λA. Based on estimates of R0 during
the initial phases of the pandemic (45, 46, 47), we set Run 0 = 3.0 for the original COVID variant.
Combining estimates from (11, 48, 49), we set Run 0 = 6.4 for the delta variant. Based on (49, 50), we
set Run 0 = 9.5 for the omicron variant. We note that changing exponential or gamma distribution
assumptions for fr and fε have a negligible impact on actual model basic reproduction number (see supplementary material), so Run represents the uncontrolled basic reproduction number for 0
all distribution and symptom onset assumptions.

Figure 3: Latent period distributions fε(x), incubation period distributions fI (x), and post- infectiousness onset recovery day distributions fr(x) as functions of the age of infection x for the original, delta, and omicron variants of COVID-19. Model simulations will consider combinations of exponential (dotted lines) and gamma (solid lines) distribution assumptions for fε and fr, as well as an incubation period symptom onset assumption using a gamma distribution for fI or a correlated symptom assumption where symptom onset coincides exactly with the onset of infectiousness.
2.2.2 Generic diseases
In addition to the COVID-19 variants, we consider a generic disease similar to the original variant but with a variable oﬀset between the mean incubation and latent period. Deﬁning z = (cid:104)fI(cid:105)−(cid:104)fε(cid:105), we consider both positive and negative z values. Positive z values represent diseases for which symptom onset typically occurs after infectiousness onset, thus allowing for signiﬁcant levels of pre- symptomatic transmission as occurs, for example, with the viruses SARS-CoV-2 and 2009 pandemic inﬂuenza H1N1 (51, 52, 28). Negative z values indicate viruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV for which symptom onset typically occurs well before infectiousness onset or peak infectivity, thus making pre-symptomatic transmission insigniﬁcant or absent entirely (28, 29). In all cases, we assume ﬁxed gamma distributions for fε and fr similar to those of the original COVID-19 variant and vary z by considering diﬀerent gamma distributed incubation periods fI . Assumed means and standard deviations for fε, fr, and fI for the speciﬁc z values under consideration are given in Table 6, and the distributions are pictured graphically in Fig. 4. Remaining model parameters are taken to be equivalent to those of COVID-19 in Table 5, where we will consider a variety of Run 0 and corresponding λA values.

2.3 Numerical integration and optimization
We compute the discretized dynamical equations for the system (7) using the upwind scheme for non-linear partial integro-diﬀerential equations with integral boundary conditions detailed in Ref. (53), and then use the midpoint method to integrate the system forward in time. We assume initial infection conditions eA(0, x)∆x = fA and eY (0, x)∆x = fY for x ∈ [0, ∆x], where ∆x = 1/6 days is the discretization length for the age of infection domain, and eA(0, x) = eA(0, y) = 0 for x > ∆x. The system is assumed otherwise to be initially completely susceptible such that S(0) = N − 1 and a(0, x) = y(0, x) = q(0, x) = R(0) = U (0) = 0 for all x. Age of infection integrals are computed using the trapezoid rule where we assume a ﬁnite domain with an upper bound xmax = 80 days (the number of infected individuals who would otherwise recover after xmax is negligible for all disease variants considered). We integrate the model equations from an initial time t0 = 0 to ﬁnal time tf = 2 years using a time step ∆t = 1/10 days. When implementing testing and quarantine control, we ﬁnd optimal allocation strategies ρ for reducing the total infection size S(t0) − S(tf ) under a variety C, η, and κ values using the fmincon function in Matlab R2021b.
3 Results
3.1 Optimal total infection size reduction and disease controllability
Figures 6 and 7 display total infection sizes under optimal resource allocation strategies as a func- tion of testing capacity for the diﬀerent COVID variants as well as the generic disease with z and Run comparable to that of delta and omicron variants (z = 1.5 days and Run 0 0 = 6.4 or 9.5). Curve color and dashing pattern represent diﬀerent combinations of assumptions regarding symptom on- set (incubation symptoms or correlated symptoms) and distributions for fε and fr (gamma or exponential) as detailed by the legend in Fig. 5. Diﬀerent plots represent diﬀerent disease variants and diﬀerent choices for η and κ values. The presented results focus on two cases in particular: “random testing” (κ = 1.00, η = 0) and “realistic testing” (κ = 0.85, η = 0.75). Random testing represents a population-wide pure random sampling non-clinical testing program, while realistic testing a represents non-clinical testing scenario more likely to be encountered in the real world, where contact tracing and natural biases result in increased testing of infected individuals but

where some of the population is inaccessible or resistant to testing eﬀorts. The case of no control is represented at zero testing capacity (C = 0). By deﬁnition, symptom onset assumptions and testing parameter values have no inﬂuence on model outcomes at C = 0, but interestingly, we see that exponential versus gamma distribution assumptions for fε and fr have no meaningful impact on total infection size at C = 0 even though model dynamics diﬀer. Generally, as the testing capacity C increases, Figs. 6 and 7 show that the total infection size decreases when resources are distributed optimally. In particular, complete disease eradication is possible at reasonably achievable testing capacities for a weaker variant when non-clinical testing can be eﬀectively targeted at individuals who are actually infected (large η in Figs. 6b and 6d). However, if non-clinical testing does not target infected individuals (small η in Figs. 6a and 6c), or if the variant is stronger (Fig. 7), eradication may not be achievable at the reduced testing capacities available during the initial phases of a novel disease outbreak. The accessibility κ has a smaller inﬂuence on reducing total infections compared to the concentration η, and disease eradication may possible even for smaller accessibility levels (Fig. 6d). This result emphasizes the importance of implementing eﬀective contact tracing programs for COVID-like diseases even if such programs can only reach a relatively small number of individuals. Together, Figs. 6 and 7 exemplify the inﬂuences of symptom onset assumptions, period distribu- tion assumptions, testing parameter values, and disease variant characteristics on disease control- lability. By controllability, we speciﬁcally mean the amount of testing capacity required to achieve a given reduction in total infection size. We consider a set ‘A’ of assumptions and parameters to be less controllable than another set ‘B’ if set ‘A’ requires a larger testing capacity to reduce total infection size to half, for example, of the uncontrolled value under optimal resource allocation strategies (see supplementary material for alternative but equivalent measures of controllability involving the basic reproduction number). Gamma versus exponential distribution assumptions for fr have a profound eﬀect on controlla- bility. Comparing a dashed curve (exponential) to a solid curve (gamma) of the same color in either Fig. 6a, 6b, or 7 shows that the gamma assumption produces a large decrease in controllability relative to the exponential assumption. On the other hand, the gamma assumption for fε increases controllability relative to the exponential assumption. This is seen in Fig. 6a, 6b, or 7 by comparing a solid orange curve to a solid blue curve or a solid purple curve to a solid gold curve, and likewise

for dashed curves. The eﬀects of incubation symptom versus correlated symptom assumptions are exempliﬁed by comparing a solid gold to solid blue curve or solid purple to solid orange curve, and likewise for dashed curves. Here, incubation symptom assumptions decrease controllability relative to correlated symptom assumptions. Interestingly, for a given assumption on fr, the decrease in controllability due to incubation symptoms is nulliﬁed to some extent by the increase in controlla- bility due to a gamma distributed fε such that solid(dashed) blue and purple curves can lie close to one another bounded by solid(dashed) red and gold curves. In other words, the IPDE speciﬁc assumptions for latent period length and symptom onset tend to counteract one another. The full IPDE model (solid purple curve) generally shows a signiﬁcant reduction in controllability relative to the full ODE model (dashed blue curve). The inﬂuences of the testing parameters η and κ on controllability are shown in Figs. 6c and 6d, where smaller values tend to decrease controllability. The inﬂuences of disease variant char- acteristics are seen by comparing Fig. 6b to the corresponding curves in all plots in Fig. 7. Here, the omicron COVID variant is signiﬁcantly less controllable than the delta variant, and the delta variant is moderately less controllable than the original variant. These controllability reductions may be caused by either increases in transmissibility or decreases in the mean latent period length associated with each COVID variant, where Run 0 = 3.0, 6.4, and 9.5 and (cid:104)fε(cid:105) = 5.48, 4.00, and 1.50 days for the original, delta, and omicron variants, respectively (the mean incubation-latent oﬀsets z and mean infectious period lengths are approximately equal for all variants). The independent inﬂuences of transmissibility and latent period length can be deduced using the generic disease in Figs. 7c and 7d. Here, the mean latent period (cid:104)fε(cid:105) = 6.00 days is comparable to that of the original variant, and comparing Fig. 6b to Figs. 7c and 7d thus shows that increases in transmissibility alone cause decreases in controllability. Likewise, comparing Fig. 7a and 7b to Fig. 7c and Fig. 7d, respectively, shows that decreases in (cid:104)fε(cid:105) alone cause decreases in controllability. A summary of all observed controllability reducing factors is given in Table 7.

3.2 Optimal allocation strategies
Figures 8 and 9 show the optimal resource allocation strategies ρ as a function of testing capacity
C corresponding to the total infection size reductions in Figs. 6 and 7. Curve colors and styles are
interpreted analogously according to the legend in Fig. 5. The value ρ = 0 represents a clinical-
testing only strategy while ρ = 1 represents a non-clinical testing only strategy, with intermediate
values represent mixed clinical and non-clinical testing strategies. In all cases, we ﬁnd that optimal
strategies call for clinical testing only at low testing capacities up to some strategy threshold capacity Cth, beyond which optimal strategies become mixed. As testing capacity increases further beyond Cth, optimal strategies call for greater and greater shares of resources to be devoted to
non-clinical testing. The insets in each plot (except Fig. 8d) zoom in on Cth values for the various distribution,
symptom, testing parameter, and disease parameter assumptions. Figures 8 and 9 show that all of these factors except the non-clinical accessibility κ are important in determining Cth, while Fig. 8d indicates that Cth is in fact independent of κ. This observation can be explained from
our model equations, where the total rate of ﬂow of infected individuals to the quarantine class due to non-clinical testing is given by τ−1 N κXN (t). At the threshold Cth, the optimal fraction of resources ρ devoted to nonclinical testing is only inﬁnitesimally larger than zero, and Eq. (5) implies (cid:16) (cid:17) τ−1 for very small ρ. We thus conclude that the XN (t)+(1−η)(S(t)+U (t)) N κXN (t) ≈ ρCN XN (t)/ rate at which individuals are quarantined by optimally allocated non-clinical testing is independent of κ at testing capacities near Cth, and that κ eﬀectively vanishes from the model equations under optimal strategies at Cth.

3.3 Controllability and the role of non-clinical testing
Figures 6, 7, 8, and 9 together depict the relationship between controllability and the role of non- clinical testing in optimal strategies. We say that the role of non-clinical testing is increased for set ‘A’ of distribution, symptom onset, testing parameter, and disease parameter assumptions relative to another set ‘B’ if the optimal ρ value at a given testing capacity for set ‘A’ is larger. Applying the same comparative analyses to Figs. 8 and 9 as was done for Figs. 6 and 7 in Sec. 3.1, we ﬁnd that, except for incubation symptoms assumption, all factors that reduce controllability in Table 7 coincide with the factors that reduce the role of non-clinical testing. There thus exists a strong re- lationship between controllability inﬂuencing factors and the role of non-clinical testing in optimal strategies. The relationship between non-clinical testing and symptom onset assumptions is more nuanced than for the other controllability reducing factors. Understanding this relationship is important for disease control, as symptom onset assumptions either incorporate (incubation symptoms) or disregard (correlated symptoms) the capacity for presymptomatic transmission associated with the incubation-latent period oﬀset for COVID-19. In some cases (compare gold to blue or purple to orange curves in Figs. 8a and 8b), incubation symptoms decrease the role of non-clinical testing relative to correlated symptoms, thus following the pattern of controllability reducing factors co- inciding with non-clinical testing reducing factors. In other cases (Fig. 9), incubation symptoms increases the role of non-clinical testing for a large range of testing capacities above the strategy thresholds Cth even though controllability is reduced. Of further complication, in these cases, there exist smaller ranges of larger testing capacities where the role of non-clinical testing is increased by the incubation symptoms assumption. We utilize strategy testing capacity thresholds Cth to analyze the relationship between non- clinical testing and symptom onset assumptions. Speciﬁcally, in Figs. 8a and 8b, the reduced roles of non-clinical testing under the incubation symptom assumptions correspond to larger Cth values in comparison to the correlated symptoms assumptions. Likewise, in Fig. 9, the enhanced roles of non-clinical testing over large ranges of testing capacities correspond to smaller Cth for incubation symptoms in comparison to correlated symptoms. Thus, increases and decreases in Cth due to symptom onset assumptions are simple indicators of decreases and increases, respectively, in the

roles of non-clinical testing. To further simplify our analysis, we restrict our attention to the most realistic model assumptions using gamma distributions for fε and fr in order to compare incubation symptoms (solid purple curves) to correlated symptoms (solid orange curves). Numerically calculating Cth values for a spectrum of η values, we plot the results as curves in the (C, η) plane, where diﬀerent curves represent diﬀerent variant and symptom onset assumptions (Fig. 10). For a given variant, if the correlated symptom curve (orange) falls to the left of the incubation symptom (purple) curve at a given η, then Cth is larger for incubation symptoms, thus implying that incubation symptoms reduce the role of non-clinical testing. Conversely, if the cor- related symptom curve falls to the right of the incubation symptoms curve, incubation symptoms enhance the role of non-clinical testing. Further, for each variant, there exists a threshold concen- tration ηth (indicated by black circles in Fig. 10), above which the role of non-clinical testing is always enhanced, and below which it is always reduced, where threshold values decrease as variant strength increases. Thus, whether or not the presence of presymptomatic transmission warrants allocation of additional resources to non-clinical testing than would otherwise be optimal depends on both variant strength and the precision to which non-clinical tests can locate infected individu- als: stronger variants require less precision in order to justify additional resources for non-clinical testing. Figure 10 is of additional value as a practical result for disease management oﬃcials when de- termining whether or not complicated resource allocation decisions need be considered. Supposing that the available testing capacity C and an estimate for the concentration η of a non-clinical testing program are known, if the corresponding (C, η) value falls to the left of or below a variant curve in Fig. 10, the optimal strategy for that variant is clinical testing only, and oﬃcials need not consider diﬃcult choices in allocating resources. Otherwise, if the (C, η) value falls to the right of or above a variant curve, the optimal strategy is mixed clinical and non-clinical testing, and oﬃcials know that critical decisions must be made in order to ensure that resources are properly allocated.

Curves represent (C, η) values where the strategy threshold capacity Cth occurs, assuming either incubation symptoms (purple) or correlated symptoms (orange) with gamma dis- tributed fr and fε. At (C, η) points above or to the right of a given curve, optimal strategies are mixed clinical and non-clinical for that variant and symptom assumption. At points below or to the left, optimal strategies are clinical only. Circles indicate points where Cth is equivalent for both symptom assumptions. At η values above a circle, incubation symptoms increases the role of non-clinical testing in optimal strategies for the corresponding variant. At η values below a circle, incubation symptoms reduce the role of non-clinical testing.

3.4 Variable incubation-latent oﬀsets
In Fig. 11, we plot optimal total infection sizes and corresponding optimal resource allocation strategies for the generic disease with Run 0 = 3.0 under a variety of incubation-latent oﬀsets z. Here, we consider only gamma distributions for fr and fε, and we consider both incubation and correlated symptom assumptions (the oﬀset z is irrelevant under correlated symptoms). The oﬀset z is found to have a strong inﬂuence on controllability (Figs. 11a and 11b); as z increases from neg- ative to positive values, controllability decreases signiﬁcantly. Thus, diseases for which symptom onset typically occurs before peak infectiousness are more easily controlled with symptom-based interventions compared to diseases for which symptom onset typically occurs after infectiousness onset (i.e. presymptomatic transmission). Further, relative to the correlated symptoms assump- tion, incubation symptoms are more controllable for z < 0 and less controllable for z > 0 (Figs. 11a and 11b). This ﬁnding agrees with the notion that diseases for which symptoms precede signif- icant infectiousness are easier to control; if a model disregards the oﬀset between symptom and infectiousness onset, it will underestimate controllability for diseases with z < 0 and overestimate controllability for diseases with z > 0. Thus, Table 1 should be modiﬁed to state that incuba- tion symptoms are a controllability reducing factor only for diseases with z > 0, while correlated symptoms are a controllability reducing factor for z < 0. For the case z = 0, controllability under incubation symptoms is close to (but not exactly equal to) controllability under correlated symp- toms (Figs. 11a and 11b). Apparently, when symptom and infectiousness onset occur together only on average rather than always together, controllability is very slightly reduced. As a function of testing capacity, optimal strategies for all z behave qualitatively similar to those of the COVID-19 variants; optimal strategies are clinical-only at low testing capacities and become mixed clinical and non-clinical beyond a threshold capacity Cth (Figs. 11c and 11d). As with the COVID-19 variants, the relationships between symptom onset assumptions, controllabil- ity, and optimal allocation strategies are complicated for the generic disease. For random testing (Fig. 11c), the role of non-clinical testing decreases (as measured by increases in Cth) as z increases for z ∈ [−4.5, 1.5], thus following the trend of controllability reducing factors coinciding with non- clinical testing reducing factors. However, the role of non-clinical testing increases for z = 4.5 days relative to z = 1.5 days even though controllability decreases. For realistic testing (Fig. 11d),

the role of non-clinical testing decreases progressively for z ∈ [−4.5, 0], after which it progressively increases. Of further complication, for larger Run 0 values (see supplementary material), the role of non-clinical testing can increase progressively as z increases despite the progressive decrease in controllability. The role of non-clinical testing for incubation symptoms relative to that of correlated symp- toms displays distinct behavior for z < 0 and z ≥ 0. Speciﬁcally, for z = −1.5 days (green curve in Figs. 11c and 11d), the role of non-clinical testing is enhanced relative to correlated symptoms at η = 0, but is reduced at η = 0.85. This behavior is counterintuitive; one would expect that if non-clinical testing is eﬀective enough at low η to have an enhanced role in optimal strategies, then it would also have an enhanced role at larger η, as increasing η would increase its eﬃcacy further. This is indeed the case for the COVID-19 variants that have a positive z approximately equal to 1.50 days (Fig. 10). For these variants, the role of non-clinical testing becomes enhanced relative to correlated symptoms at some threshold concentration ηth, and then remains enhanced for all η > ηth. Figure 12 presents the analog to Fig. 10 for the generic disease for Run 0 = 3.0 (see supplementary material for Run 0 = 6.4 and Run 0 = 9.5). Here, we numerically calculate the strategy threshold capacities Cth for a spectrum of η values for each z oﬀset and the correlated symptoms assumptions, and then plot the results as curves in the (C, η) plane. For each z curve, there is a threshold concentration ηth where a crossing with the correlated symptoms curve occurs. z ≥ 0 curves are to the right of the correlated symptoms curve for η < ηth (indicating diminished non- clinical testing roles) and to the left for η > ηth (indicating enhanced non-clinical testing roles). However, z < 0 curves are to the left of the correlated symptoms curve for η < ηth (indicating enhanced non-clinical testing roles) and to the right for η > ηth (indicating diminished non-clinical testing roles). We thus ﬁnd major qualitative diﬀerences between z > 0 diseases (i.e. those with presymptomatic transmission) and z < 0 diseases (i.e those with preinfectiousness symptom onset) in regards to the inﬂuence of realistic incubation and latent periods on optimal resource allocation strategies relative to simpler models. From Figs. 10 and 12 (as well as the corresponding plots in the supplementary material), it is clear that threshold concentrations ηth depend on both the incubation-latent oﬀset z and the overall transmissibility as measured by Run 0 , and may also depend on the mean latent period length. To visualize these inﬂuences, we ﬁnd the thresholds ηth numerically for the z ≤ 0 diseases as well

as the COVID-19 variants, assuming a spectrum of Run 0 values for each model by changing the overall transmissibility. The results are plotted in Fig. 13 as curves in the (Run 0 , η) plane, where each curve represents ηth values for a diﬀerent set of gamma distributed latent and incubation periods taken from Tables 2, 3, 4, and 6, assuming gamma distributions for fr. If a disease man- agement oﬃcial is designing a testing resource allocation strategy to control a disease for which they know the basic reproduction number and an estimate for their testing program’s η reproduction, they can locate the corresponding point in Fig. 13. If their point falls above the relevant incuba- tion/latent period assumption curve, then due to presymptomatic transmission, optimal strategies will call for an increase in non-clinical testing resources relative to a comparable simpler disease for which infectiousness and symptoms always coincide. If their point falls below the relevant in- cubation/latent period assumption curve, optimal strategies will call for a reduction in non-clinical testing relative to a comparable simpler disease despite the presence of presymptomatic transmis- sion. Generally, smaller Run 0 values require greater η in order to justify allocating extra resources to non-clinical testing, thus corroborating our previous observation that stronger diseases require less precise non-clinical testing programs (i.e smaller η) in order to justify allocating additional resources to non-clinical testing due to presymptomatic transmission. We see further that larger z diseases and diseases with shorter latent periods (compare the omicron curve to the z = 1.50 curve) likewise require less precision in order to justify increasing resources to non-clinical testing. In other words, the factors of larger Run 0 , larger z, and smaller latent period expand the param- eter space for which non-clinical testing is enhanced in optimal strategies due to presymptomatic transmission. Note that as Run falls below 2.0, enhanced non-clinical testing is never justiﬁed. 0 Thus, suﬃciently weak diseases do not warrant additional non-clinical testing resources, even if presymptomatic transmission may be signiﬁcant.

4.1 Curbing epidemics under resource limitations
4.1 Curbing epidemics under resource limitations
The results of our work largely corroborate the optimality of the testing strategies adopted by real- world disease management planners during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Namely, when testing resources are in short supply, they should be reserved for the most symptomatic and critically ill patients (6, 7, 8). Although these policies may have been adopted in order to prevent mortality, we have found that they are also good policies for suppressing the epidemic. More generally, our work shows that such policies are optimal for a broad range of disease characteristics and non-clinical testing program characteristics. Diseases with longer or shorter latent periods, stronger or weaker transmissibility, presymptomatic transmission or preinfectiousness symptom onset or correlated symptom-infectiousness onset, and exponential or gamma period distributions all call for qualitatively similar polices as a function of testing capacity; optimal protocols call for clinical-only testing at testing capacities below a threshold Cth, and call for mixed clinical and non-clinical strategies at greater testing capacities. Interestingly, in a previous work (18) where we analyzed optimally reducing the epidemic peak height (rather than total infection size) using the ODE of our model here, we observed the same threshold behavior separating testing capacity regions between optimal clinical-only and mixed strategies. Thus, the threshold behavior appears to be a general feature of optimal allocation strategies under limited testing resources. Figures 6, 7, and 11 depicting optimal total infection size for “realistic” and “random” non- clinical testing programs illuminate the feasibility or infeasibility of curbing a novel disease outbreak with a testing a quarantine program. Random testing (η = 0) is unlikely to be successful at the low testing capacities expected at the initial stages of an novel disease outbreak as production of newly developed tests falls well behind demand, even if the entire population is accessible and amenable to the limited number of tests available (κ = 1). However, signiﬁcant disease suppression is possible at larger concentrations η even if the overall accessibility κ is small. This result stresses the importance of early implementation of eﬀective contact tracing and public outreach programs encouraging individuals with suspected or probable recent transmission to seek testing, even if signiﬁcant portions of the population are not open or accessible to such eﬀorts. Importantly, this conclusion holds for the spectrum of model assumptions and disease characteristics analyzed in this

4.2 Inﬂuence of model assumptions on controllability
Throughout this work, we have identiﬁed a number of disease characteristics and model assump- tions that inﬂuence predictions of controllability. Model assumptions are critically important, as we have found that the equivalent ODE model can severely overestimate controllability relative to the more realistic full IPDE model. A major contributing factor to this eﬀect is the gamma period distribution assumption for fr in the IPDE model. This observation accords with previous models with identiﬁcation + isolation/quarantine controls, where it was observed that an exponentially distributed infectious period can signiﬁcantly overestimate controllability relative to a gamma dis- tribution (27). In essence, quarantining is more eﬀective under the exponential assumption due to its ability to signiﬁcantly reduce the infectious period length of individuals in the long tail of the distribution (see Fig. 3). Likewise, under the exponential assumption, signiﬁcantly larger numbers individuals recover naturally within the ﬁrst few days of infectiousness onset in comparison to the gamma assumption, so delays in testing due to low capacity are irrelevant in these cases and are thus less detrimental to controllability. Conversely, for the latent period distribution, a gamma distribution assumption increases controllability relative to the exponential assumption (although to a lesser degree than that with which a gamma fr reduces controllability) for reasons analogous to those of infectious period. Namely, under the exponential assumption, much larger numbers of individuals rapidly transition from exposed to infectious in comparison to the gamma distribu- tion, so there is less time to locate and remove new infections before they begin generating new transmissions, and delays in identifying and quarantining infections due to supply limitations are thus more detrimental. On a more basic level, although gamma distributions for fε and fr have no noticeable eﬀect on total infection size under no control, they ﬂatten/delay and sharpen/accelerate the uncontrolled epidemic peak, respectively, as compared to exponential distributions (see the supplementary material). Intuitively, a disease that peaks earlier and to a greater degree on its on volition will be more diﬃcult to control.
Symptom onset assumptions based on the age-of-infection can reduce or increase controllability depending on the incubation-latent oﬀset z, as controllability generally decreases as z increases. Under correlated symptoms, active spreaders in the eventually symptomatic class always show

symptoms and are thus always targeted with eﬃcacious clinical testing. Under incubation symp- toms, however, positive z values imply presymptomatic transmissions, meaning that some of the active spreaders can only be targeted with non-clinical testing which is subject to delays due to resources being wasted on uninfected individuals. These delays become more detrimental as the presymptomatic transmission window becomes larger, so controllability tends to decrease as z in- creases. For negative z, however, some individuals become symptomatic while still in the exposed class, so eﬃcacious clinical testing can be used to remove infected individuals with minimal delay before than can begin generating new transmissions. This is impossible under correlated symp- toms or positive z values. The opportunity for clinical testing to remove preinfectious individuals increases as z grows in the negative direction, and controllability consequently increases. Notably, the increase in controllability can be signiﬁcant for a negative z disease compared to a positive z disease. This observation may explain why the 2003 SARS outbreak (negative z disease) was far easier to control than the COVID-19 pandemic (positive z disease) (54). The remaining controllability reducing factors are straightforwardly explained. Namely, a more transmissible disease (i.e. one with a larger Run 0 ) is inherently more diﬃcult to control than a less transmissible disease, and the larger number of secondary infections generated by an individual can be detrimental to control when limited resources force delays in testing and quarantine. Likewise, shorter latent periods leave less time to locate infected individuals before they begin generating transmissions, so testing and quarantine delays become more costly. These factors together help explain why the omicron variant has been particularly challenging to control (49, 55). The large Run 0 value is an oft emphasized contributing factor, but the short latent period relative to other variants can be just as important. Explicitly, comparing the generic disease (mean latent period 6 days) to the omicron variant (mean latent period 1.5 days) in Fig. 7 shows that omicron is roughly half as controllable despite both diseases having the same Run 0 .
4.3 Controllability, symptom onset, and the role of non-clinical testing
Our results across all model assumptions demonstrate a consistent clear relationship between non- clinical testing and controllability reducing factors unrelated to symptom onset assumptions: factors which reduce controllability also reduce the role of non-clinical testing in optimal strategies. We hypothesize that this relationship arises because wasted or ineﬃciently used resources are of greater

detriment in a less controllable system. That is, when a disease is considered less controllable, fail- ure to utilize a quantity of testing capacity to identify and isolate infected individuals will result in a greater number of additional infections in comparison to a more controllable disease. With non- clinical testing, the beneﬁcial impact of identifying removing non-symptomatic infected individuals is counterbalanced by the negative impact of potentially wasting tests on uninfected individuals, and the negative impact becomes more prominent as the disease becomes less controllable. Thus, optimal strategies place more emphasis on clinical testing which is guarantied to be utilized to iden- tify and isolate an infected individual. However, for suﬃciently large testing capacity, resources are plentiful enough such that wasting a test on an uninfected individual does not signiﬁcantly delay or inhibit identiﬁcation of infected individuals, so the role of non-clinical testing can be prominent in a less controllable disease, although still slightly diminished in comparison to a more controllable disease. Thus, the observed relationship between the role of non-clinical testing and controllability is closely tied to the resource limitation aspects of model. In contrast to factors unrelated to symptom onset, the relationship between non-clinical testing controllability factors related to symptom onset assumptions is unclear. One one hand, one might expect that for a negative z disease like COVID-19, realistically modeling the incubation-latent oﬀset will increase the role of of non-clinical testing in comparison to a model making the simpler correlated symptom assumption due to non-clinical testing’s ability to capture presymptomatic spreaders. On the other hand, since the latent incubation oﬀset decreases controllability for a neg- ative z disease, one might expect non-clinical testing’s role to be diminished due to the reasoning given in the preceding paragraph. We found that neither of these hypotheses are generally correct for guiding optimal strategies based on the results of simple ODE models. Instead, we found that age-of-infection modeling, and in particular, the details of the temporal oﬀset between the incu- bation and latent periods, was critical to understanding disease progression, controllability, and optimal strategies for resource allocation. Our results show that in reality, optimal policies for resource allocation depend on a compli- cated (often non-intuitive) interplay between incubation-latent oﬀset, disease strength, and other characteristics like latent period length (Figs. 11, 12, 13, and the corresponding ﬁgures in the sup- plementary material). This is a critical observation because real-world public policies and attitudes towards a novel diseases are typically based on what has been successful for previous diseases com-

bined with basic intuition for the broad diﬀerences between the novel disease and previous diseases. For example, 2003 SARS has no presymptomatic transmission while COVID-19 has signiﬁcant presymptomatic transmission, so one might intuitively expect that a successful strategy for con- trolling 2003 SARS should be adapted for COVID-19 by allocating more resources to non-clinical testing in order to capture presymptomatic spreaders, but this is not at all the case according to our results. Our work shows that this intuition-based approach to public policy can fail, and thus highlights the importance of mathematical modeling in helping to guide disease management. In particular, it is important to establish modeling frameworks where diﬀerent diseases can be exam- ined comparatively under the same lens to more closely mimic the way diseases are compared in the real world. Utilizing the age-of-infection to decouple symptom status from speciﬁc model compart- ments is the crucial element for allowing such comparisons in our model. Future models may build upon these ideas to incorporate not only the age-of-infection, but also the age-of-infectiousness in order to model additional realistic features like partial correlations between incubation, latent, and infectious period lengths as well as time-varying infectivity levels dependent on the time since infectiousness or symptom onset.
