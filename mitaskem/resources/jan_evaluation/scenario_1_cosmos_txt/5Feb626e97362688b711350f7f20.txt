Abstract Inﬂuenza usually breaks out seasonally in temperate regions, especially in winter, infection rates and mortality rates of inﬂuenza increase signiﬁcantly, which means that dry air and cold temperatures accelerate the spread of inﬂuenza viruses. However, the meteorological factors that lead to seasonal inﬂuenza outbreaks and how these meteorological factors play a decisive role in inﬂuenza transmission remain unclear. During the epidemic of infectious diseases, the neglect of unreported cases leads to an underestimation of infection rates and basic reproduction number. In this paper, we propose a new non-autonomous periodic differential equation model with mete- orological factors including unreported cases. First, the basic reproduction number is obtained and the global asymptotic stability of the disease-free periodic solution is proved. Furthermore, the existence of periodic solutions and the uniformly persistence of the model are demonstrated. Second, the best-ﬁt parameter values in our model are identiﬁed by the MCMC algorithm on the basis of the inﬂuenza data in Gansu province, China. We also estimate that the basic reproduction number is 1.2288 (95% CI:(1.2287, 1.2289)). Then, to determine the key parameters of the model, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis are explored. Finally, our results show that inﬂuenza is more likely to spread in low temperature, low humidity and low precipitation environments. Temperature is a more important factor than relative humidity and precipitation dur- ing the inﬂuenza epidemic. In addition, our results also show that there are far more unreported cases than reported cases.

1 Introduction
Inﬂuenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by an inﬂuenza virus. Inﬂuenza is a highly contagious and rapidly spreading disease that spreads mainly through droplets in the air, human to human contact, and contact between people and contaminated objects. Typical clinical symptoms are systemic fever, generalized weakness, and res- piratory infections. Inﬂuenza viruses cause widespread morbidity and mortality among human populations worldwide: In China alone, there were 153 deaths and 765,186 infections in 2018 (National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China 2019). In particular, due to the relatively backward medical and health conditions, inﬂuenza is particularly serious in Gansu Province, China. In temperate regions like China, the effects of inﬂuenza occur mainly in the winter (Lowen et al. 2007; Mourt- zoukou and Falagas 2007); that is, inﬂuenza outbreaks are highly predictable seasonal patterns. In the northern hemisphere, inﬂuenza viruses are prevalent from November to March (Viboud et al. 2006). Inﬂuenza is highly contagious and spreads rapidly. This feature is the root cause of the signiﬁcant morbidity and economic burden of health care. Several factors are thought to be responsible for the seasonal outbreak of inﬂuenza, including temperature, humidity, rainfall, pH, salinity, indoor crowding, and sunlight (Eccles 2002; Kudo et al. 2019; Lowen and Steel 2014; Sooryanarain and Elankumaran 2015; Tamerius et al. 2010). A study that analyzed data from more than 30 years in the USA found that absolute humidity decline (depending on relative humidity and temperature) is closely related to the number of inﬂuenza-related deaths (Shaman et al. 2010). The seasonality of the ﬂu depends to a large extent on temperature and humidity. Cool and dry conditions can improve the survival rate and transmission rate of inﬂuenza virus in temperate regions (Sooryanarain and Elankumaran 2015). There are many studies on the effects of meteorological factors such as temperature and humidity on inﬂuenza viruses (Foxman et al. 2015; Kudo et al. 2019; Loosli et al. 1943; Lowen and Steel 2014; Lowen et al. 2007; Mäkinen et al. 2009; Pyankov et al. 2018; Tamerius et al. 2013). As early as, Loosli et al. (1943) showed that inﬂuenza viruses were more susceptible to inactivation in high humidity atmospheres. Lowen et al. (2007) allowed hundreds of guinea pigs to contact the same human inﬂuenza virus at different temperatures and humidity. The team found that at room temperature, the spread of inﬂuenza peaked at relatively low humidity (20–35%). Inﬂuenza is less likely to spread when the humidity is around 50%, and does not spread at all when the humidity exceeds 80%. The study also found that temperature was a more important factor than humidity. Under certain conditions of humidity, the guinea pigs would get ◦ C, and the ﬂu virus would not invade when the temperature the ﬂu at a temperature of 5 is high. Shaman et al. (2010) showed that the absolute humidity alone was sufﬁcient to produce the seasonality of inﬂuenza. This ﬁnding provides epidemiological support for the hypothesis that absolute humidity drives seasonal changes in inﬂuenza in temperate regions. Mäkinen et al. (2009) showed that low temperature and low humidity were associated with increased respiratory infections. Lowen and Steel (2014) showed that the spread of inﬂuenza virus was strongly regulated by temperature and humidity. They revealed a strong correlation between ﬂu incidence in temperate regions and local humidity and temperature conditions. Kudo et al. (2019) found that exposure of mice

to low humidity and low temperatures made them more susceptible to inﬂuenza. They showed that dry air combined with cold temperature could achieve viral transmission. There are relatively few studies on the transmission model of the correlation between inﬂuenza and weather factors such as temperature and humidity (Handel et al. 2013; Xing et al. 2017). Handel et al. (2013) showed that the temperature decay rate of inﬂuenza virus in the environment was described as δ(T ) = αeγ T , where T was the temperature, α and γ were constants. Xing et al. (2017) used the temperature dependent decay function of the inﬂuenza virus studied by Handel et al. (2013) to evaluate the cause of recurrence of H7N9 avian inﬂuenza in China. Other studying the effects of temperature, humidity, or other factors on infectious diseases or other social epidemics; please see Bao and Li (2020), Bao et al. (2020), Guo et al. (2019), Huo et al. (2018, 2019a, b), Ma (2019), Meng and Wu (2018), Tang et al. (2018), Wang et al. (2016a), Xiang et al. (2019), Zhao et al. (2019), Zhang et al. (2019) and references cited therein. The reported cases usually are only a small fraction of the total number of cases during the outbreak of infectious diseases. Unreported cases are the majority of the total number of cases. Recently, many scholars have studied unreported cases during the outbreak of epidemics (Ducrot et al. 2019; Gamado et al. 2014, 2017; Grubaugh et al. 2019; Magal and Webb 2018). The neglect of unreported cases often leads to an underestimation of infection rates and basic reproduction number in epidemic model (Gamado et al. 2017), which will have a serious impact on the control spread of disease. Gamado et al. (2014) showed that epidemiological and socioeconomic factors were the main causes of underreporting. Magal and Webb (2018) analyzed the relationship between unreported cases and reported cases. They showed that the proportion of unreported cases to reported cases was very high, which was of great signiﬁcance in implementing measures to control the epidemic. Grubaugh et al. (2019) discovered an unreported outbreak of Zika virus in Cuba through the detection of tourism data and genomics. Motivated by the above (Handel et al. 2013; Sooryanarain and Elankumaran 2015; Wang et al. 2016b; Xing et al. 2017), we propose a new non-autonomous differential equation model with meteorological factors in this paper. Since the poor public medical conditions in Gansu Province, the reported cases are only a part, and most of the inﬂuenza patients are not treated or treated with family therapy, we also introduce unreported compartment in the model. We derive the basic reproduction number and study stability of disease-free periodic solution. We also demonstrate the existence of positive periodic solutions and the uniformly persistence of the model. Further, we identify the best-ﬁt parameter values in our model by the MCMC algorithm on the basis of the inﬂuenza data in Gansu province, China. We also estimate that the basic reproduction number is 1.2288 (95% CI:(1.2287, 1.2289)). Then, we explore uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to determine the key parameters of the model. The organization of this paper is as follows: In Sect. 2, we propose a new non- autonomous differential equation inﬂuenza model with meteorological factors, and we get the invariant set of the model and the basic reproduction number R0. The global asymptotic stability of the disease-free periodic solution of the model is also demonstrated. The uniformly persistence of model and the existence of a positive T -periodic solution have also been proved. In Sect. 3, we use the MCMC algorithm

to estimate the unknown parameters and initial values of the model. The basic repro- duction number R0 of the model and its conﬁdence interval are solved by numerical methods. In Sect. 4, The effects of several meteorological factors on the number of inﬂuenza cases are studied. At the same time, we use the LHS (Latin hypercube sam- pling) method and the PRCC (partial rank correlation coefﬁcient) method to obtain the uncertainty and sensitivity of the unknown parameters of the model. In Sect. 5, we give some discussions and conclusions.
2 Model Derivation
2.1 System Description
The total population is divided into ﬁve compartments: S(t ), E (t ), IN (t ), IC (t ) and R(t ). S(t ) represents the number of susceptible individuals; E (t ) denotes the number of exposed individuals; IN (t ) represents the unreported cases by the CDC in Gansu Province, including asymptomatic infected individuals and some symp- tomatic infected individuals; IC (t ) represents the reported cases by the CDC in Gansu Province; R(t ) represents the number of refectious individuals. Let V (t ) be the density of inﬂuenza virus in a polluted environment, including droplets in the air, contaminated items, etc. The total number of population at time t is given by
N (t ) = S(t ) + E (t ) + IN (t ) + IC (t ) + R(t ).
The population ﬂow among those compartments is shown in the following diagram (see Fig. 1). Human infection can be divided into two categories: One is the transmission rate of direct contact between susceptible individuals and infected individuals, which is expressed in β(t ); the other is the transmission rate of indirect contact between sus- ceptible individuals and inﬂuenza viruses in the environment, which is expressed in ρ(t ). As we mentioned in Introduction, the viability of inﬂuenza viruses is affected by

meteorological factors. Therefore, the clearance rate of inﬂuenza virus is a function of time, which is expressed by μ(t ). All the parameters and periodic functions with period of T are assumed to be positive and detailed deﬁnitions are given in Table 1. We establish a non-autonomous differential equation as

73 Page 6 of 36 S.-L. Jing et al.
The trajectories of the model (1) are bounded, and the set Ω is a positive invariant set. In particular, (S(t ), E (t ), IN (t ), IC (t ), R(t ), V (t )) is positive for all t > 0 if the initial values S(0) > 0, E (0) > 0, IN (0) > 0, IC (0) > 0, R(0) > 0 and V (0) > 0 at t = 0.
Proof First, we prove the nonnegativity of the solution of model (1). By the continuous dependence of solutions with respect to initial values, we only need to prove that when the initial values S(0) > 0, E (0) > 0, IN (0) > 0, IC (0) > 0, R(0) > 0 and V (0) > 0, (S(t ), E (t ), IN (t ), IC (t ), R(t ), V (t )) is positive for all t > 0. Let
(cid:8) (cid:9) , W (t ) = min for all t > 0. S(t ), E (t ), IN (t ), IC (t ), R(t ), V (t ) It is clear that W (0) > 0. Assuming that there exists a t1 > 0 such that W (t1) = 0
It is clear that W (0) > 0. Assuming that there exists a t1 > 0 such that W (t1) = 0 and W (t ) > 0, for all t ∈ [0, t1). If W (t1) = S(t1), then IN (t ) ≥ 0, IN (t ) ≥ 0, R(t ) ≥ 0 and V (t ) ≥ 0 for all t ∈ [0, t1]. From the ﬁrst equation of model (1), we can obtain
dS ≥ −β(t )S(θ IC + IN ) − ρ(t )SV − dS, for all t ∈ [0, t1]. dt
Thus, we have
− (cid:10) t1 0 [β(ζ )(θ IC+IN )+ρ(ζ )V+d]dζ > 0, 0 = S(t1) ≥ S(0)e
which leads to a contradiction. Thus, S(t ) > 0 for all t ≥ 0. Similarly, we can also prove that E (t ) > 0, IN (t ) > 0, IN (t ) > 0, R(t ) > 0 and V (t ) > 0 for all t ≥ 0. Second, we prove that the solution of model (1) is uniformly and ultimately bounded. From model (1), we know that the total population N (t ) satisﬁes the follow- ing equation:
dN = dS + dE + dIN + dIC + dR = Λ − d N . dt dt dt dt dt dt
This implies
(cid:12) + (cid:11) −dt , N (t ) = Λ N (0) − Λ e d d where N (0) represents the total population at time t = 0.
where N (0) represents the total population at time t = 0. Then it follows that limt→∞ sup N (t ) ≤ Λ d . Through the last equation of model (1), we obtain
dV − μ(t )V . = α(IC + IN ) − μ(t )V ≤ 2Λα d dt
123
73 Modeling the Effects of Meteorological Factors and Unreported Cases… Page 7 of 36
Since μ(t ) is a continuous, positive periodic function, it is easy to get μ(t ) to be bounded. Let us assume that U = min{μ(t )}, for ∀t ≥ 0. Therefore, we get the following inequality:
dV = 2Λα − μ(t )V ≤ 2Λα − U V d d dt
This implies
(cid:13) (cid:14) + −U t , V (t ) ≤ 2Λα V (0) − 2Λα e dU dU where V (0) indicates the number of viruses at time t = 0.
where V (0) indicates the number of viruses at time t = 0. Then it follows that limt→∞ sup V (t ) ≤ 2Λα dU . Therefore, we obtain the positive invariant set of model (1) as
Ω = (cid:6) (S, E , IN , IC , R, V ) ∈ R6+ : 0 ≤ S, E , IN , IC , R, N = S + E + IN + IC + R (cid:7) . ≤ Λ , 0 ≤ V ≤ 2αΛ (2) d dU (cid:9)(cid:10)

2.3 The Basic Reproduction Number for the Periodic System
Taking into account the cyclical changes in the inﬂuenza, we can examine the basic reproduction number of the periodic model (1). It is easy to see that model (1) always , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). Then we can use the theory has a disease-free periodic solution P0 = ( Λ d proposed by Wang and Zhao (2008) to deﬁne basic reproduction number of model (1). Let x = (E , IN , IC , R, V , S)T , model (1) can be written as
dx(t ) = F (t , x) − V(t , x), dt
where
⎡ ⎤ β(t )S(IN + θ IC ) + ρ(t )SV ⎢ ⎥ 0 ⎢ ⎥ ⎢ ⎥ 0 ⎢ ⎥ , ⎢ ⎥ 0 ⎢ ⎥ ⎣ ⎦ 0 0

It is very clear that the conditions (A1)–(A5) of the theory proposed by Wang and Zhao (2008) are satisﬁed. Let f (t , x(t )) = F (t , x) − V(t , x), and we deﬁne
(3)
(cid:22) , M(t ) := (cid:21) ∂ f6(t , x 0(t )) ∂x6
where x 0(t ) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, Λ ) is the disease-free periodic solution. d = M(t )z. Let ΦM (t ) be the monodromy matrix of the linear T -periodic system dz dt Therefore, we obtain ΦM (t ) = e −dt , which implies the spectral radius ρ(ΦM (T )) of ΦM (T ) is less than unity. It is very clear that the condition (A6) of the theory proposed by Wang and Zhao (2008) is also satisﬁed. In order to verify that condition (A7) is established, we deﬁne F (t ) = (cid:22) (cid:22) (cid:21) ∂Fi (t ,x 0(t )) ∂Vi (t ,x 0(t )) and V (t ) = (cid:21) , where Fi (t , x) and Vi (t , x) ∂x j ∂x j 1≤i , j≤5 1≤i , j≤5 are the i-th component of F (t , x) and V(t , x), respectively. Then, we obtain
⎡ ⎤ β(t )Λ β(t )Λθ ρ(t )Λ 0 0 d d d ⎢ ⎥ 0 0 0 0 0 ⎢ ⎥ ⎢ ⎥ , F (t ) = (4) 0 0 0 0 0 ⎢ ⎥ ⎣ ⎦ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

dy = −V (t )y. dt
It is very clear that F (t ) is nonnegative and −V (t ) is cooperative in the sense that the off-diagonal elements of −V (t ) are nonnegative. Let Y (t , s), t ≥ s, be the evolution operator of the linear T -periodic system
123

That is, for each s ∈ R, the 5 × 5 matrix Y (t , s) satisﬁes
dY (t , s) = −V (t )Y (t , s), ∀t ≥ s, Y (s, s) = I , (7) dt where I is the 5 × 5 identity matrix.
where I is the 5 × 5 identity matrix. = Let Φ−V (t ) be the monodromy matrix of the linear T -periodic system dy dt −V (t )y, and it is clear that ρ(Φ−V (T )) = max
(cid:9) (cid:8) −μ(T )T < 1. e −(σ+d)T , e −(γ2+d+κ)T , e −(γ1+d)T , e −(q+d)T , e ρ(Φ−V (T )) = max
Therefore, the condition (A7) of the theory proposed by Wang and Zhao (2008) is also satisﬁed. According to the method in Wang and Zhao (2008), we assume that φ (s) is the initial distribution of infectious individuals, and φ (s) is T -periodic in s. Therefore, F (s)φ (s) is the distribution of new individuals generated by infected individuals at time s. Y (t , s)F (s)φ (s) gives the distribution of infected individuals who are newly infected by φ (s) and remain in the infected compartment at time s, when t ≥ s. Then we deﬁne −∞ Y (t , s)F (s)φ (s)ds = (cid:23) ∞
t ψ (t ) := (cid:23) Y (t , t − a)F (t − a)φ (t − a)da, (8) −∞ Y (t , s)F (s)φ (s)ds = (cid:23) ∞ 0
where ψ (t ) represents the distribution of accumulated newly infected individuals produced by all infected individuals φ (s) introduced at previous time to t. Let CT be the ordered Banach space of all T -periodic functions from R to R5 with + the maximum norm (cid:11) · (cid:11) and the positive cone C := {φ ∈ CT : φ (t ) ≥ 0, ∀t ∈ R}. T According to the method in Wang and Zhao (2008), we can deﬁne a linear operator L : CT → CT as follows (Lφ)(t ) = (cid:23) ∞
(9) Y (t , t − a)F (t − a)φ (t − a)da, ∀t ∈ R, φ ∈ CT .
(Lφ)(t ) = (cid:23) ∞ Y (t , t − a)F (t − a)φ (t − a)da, ∀t ∈ R, φ ∈ CT . 0
(Lφ)(t ) = (cid:23) ∞ Y (t , t − a)F (t − a)φ (t − a)da, ∀t ∈ R, φ ∈ CT .
(10)
L is called the next-generation infection operator and the spectral radius of L is deﬁned as the basic reproduction number R0. Therefore, the basic reproduction number R0 of model (1) can be expressed as follows R0 := ρ(L).
R0 := ρ(L).
Lemma 2.3.1 [see Theorem 2.2 in Wang and Zhao (2008)]. The following statements are valid: (1) R0 = 1 if and only if ρ(ΦF−V (T )) = 1.
(1) R0 = 1 if and only if ρ(ΦF−V (T )) = 1. (2) R0 > 1 if and only if ρ(ΦF−V (T )) > 1. (3) R0 < 1 if and only if ρ(ΦF−V (T )) < 1.
Therefore, the disease-free periodic solution ρ0 of model (1) is locally asymptotically stable if R0 < 1 and unstable if R0 > 1.

In order to calculate the basic reproduction number R0 of model (1), according to Theorem 2.1 in Wang and Zhao (2008), we introduce the linear T -periodic system as follows
(cid:25) dω = (cid:24) − V (t ) + F (t ) ω, t ∈ R, (11) λ dt where parameter λ ∈ (0,∞). Then, let the evolution operator of system (11) on R5
where parameter λ ∈ (0,∞). Then, let the evolution operator of system (11) on R5 be W (t , s, λ), t ≥ s, s ∈ R. It is clear that ΦF−V (t ) = W (t , 0, 1), t ≥ 0 can be obtained. Hence, we derive
ΦF /λ−V (t ) = W (t , 0, λ), t ≥ 0,
where
⎡ ⎤ β(t )Λ β(t )Λθ ρ(t )Λ −(σ + d) 0 λd λd λd ⎢ ⎥ 0 0 0 ⎢ ⎥ (1 − δ)σ −(γ2 + d + κ) ⎢ ⎥ = . δσ κ −V (t ) + F (t ) 0 0 ⎢ ⎥ −(γ1 + d) λ ⎣ ⎦ −(q + d) 0 0 γ2 γ1 α α −μ(t ) 0 0
Lemma 2.3.2 [see Theorem 2.1 in Wang and Zhao (2008)]. The following statements are valid: (1) If ρ(W (T , 0, λ)) = 1 has a positive solution λ0, then λ0 is an eigenvalue of L,
(1) If ρ(W (T , 0, λ)) = 1 has a positive solution λ0, then λ0 is an eigenvalue of L, and hence R0 > 0. (2) If R0 > 0, then λ = R0 is the unique solution of ρ(W (T , 0, λ)) = 1. (3) R0 = 0 if and only if ρ(W (T , 0, λ)) < 1 for all λ > 0.
Therefore, we can use the numerical algorithm to calculate the basic reproduction number according to (2) in Lemma 2.3.2.
2.4 Extinction of the Disease
Let (Rn, Rn+) be the standard n-dimensional Euclidean space. For u, v ∈ Rn, if u−v ∈ Rn+, then u ≥ v; if u − v ∈ Rn+\{0}, then u > v; if u − v ∈ I nt (Rn+), then u (cid:12) v. Let A(t ) be a continuous, cooperative and irreducible n × n matrix function of the T -period, and ΦA(t ) is the fundamental solution matrix of the following system
dx(t ) = A(t )x(t ). dt
Let ρ(ΦA(T )) be the spectral radius of ΦA(T ). Thus each element of matrix ΦA(T ) is positive at T > 0 (Aronsson and Kellogg 1978; Hirsch 1985). Through Perron- Frobenius theorem (Smith and Waltman 1995), ρ(ΦA(T )) is the principal eigenvalue of ΦA(T ) in the sense that it is simple and admits an eigenvector v∗ (cid:12) 0. Therefore, we have a conclusion as follows

Lemma 2.4.1 [see Zhang and Zhao (2007)]. Let p = 1 T ln ρ(ΦA(T )). Then there exists a positive, T -periodic function v(t ) such that e pt v(t ) is a solution of dx(t ) = A(t )x(t ). dt Theorem 2.4.1 Disease-free periodic solution P0 = ( Λ

Proof By Lemma 2.3.1, we obtain that the disease-free periodic solution P0 = ( Λ , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is locally asymptotically stable for R0 < 1, and the disease-free d periodic solution P0 = ( Λ , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is unstable for R0 > 1. Therefore, we only d , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is globally need to prove that the disease-free periodic solution P0 = ( Λ d attractive for R0 < 1. From model (1) and lemma (2.2.1), we have

which implies that
. lim t→∞ sup(S(t ) + E (t ) + IN (t ) + IC (t ) + R(t )) ≤ Λ d
Because E (t ) ≥ 0, IN (t ) ≥ 0, IC (t ) ≥ 0 and R(t ) ≥ 0 for all t ≥ 0, it follows that
. lim t→∞ sup S(t ) ≤ Λ d
Thus, for ∀η > 0, there exists ¯t > 0 such that S(t ) ≤ Λ + η for t > ¯t. We consider d the following comparison system

Let x = ( ˆE , ˆIN , ˆIC , ˆR, ˆV )T, system (12) is equivalent to the following equation
(cid:12) (cid:14) = (cid:11) x F (t ) − V (t ) + ηm(t ) x,

According to Lemma 2.4.1, we know that there is a positive T -periodic function v(t ) such that e pt v(t ) is a solution of system (12), where v(t ) = (v1(t ), v2(t ), v3(t ), v4(t ), v5(t )) and p = 1 T ln ρ(ΦF−V+ηm (T )). Next, we choose ˜t > ¯t and all small τ > 0 to make the inequality as follows ˆE (˜t ) ≤ τ v1(0), ˆIN (˜t ) ≤ τ v2(0), ˆIC (˜t ) ≤ τ v3(0), ˆR(˜t ) ≤ τ v4(0), ˆV (˜t ) ≤ τ v5(0),
ˆE (˜t ) ≤ τ v1(0), ˆIN (˜t ) ≤ τ v2(0), ˆIC (˜t ) ≤ τ v3(0), ˆR(˜t ) ≤ τ v4(0), ˆV (˜t ) ≤ τ v5(0),
then, we get ˆE (t ) ≤ τ e p(t−˜t )v1(t − ˜t ),
ˆE (t ) ≤ τ e p(t−˜t )v1(t − ˜t ), ˆIN (t ) ≤ τ e p(t−˜t )v2(t − ˜t ), ˆIC (t ) ≤ τ e p(t−˜t )v3(t − ˜t ), ˆR(t ) ≤ τ e p(t−˜t )v4(t − ˜t ), ˆV (t ) ≤ τ e p(t−˜t )v5(t − ˜t ), t ≥ ˜t .
According to the standard comparison principle, we obtain the inequality as follows E (t ) ≤ ˆE (t ) ≤ τ e p(t−˜t )v1(t − ˜t ), IN (t ) ≤ ˆIN (t ) ≤ τ e p(t−˜t )v2(t − ˜t ),
E (t ) ≤ ˆE (t ) ≤ τ e p(t−˜t )v1(t − ˜t ), IN (t ) ≤ ˆIN (t ) ≤ τ e p(t−˜t )v2(t − ˜t ), IC (t ) ≤ ˆIC (t ) ≤ τ e p(t−˜t )v3(t − ˜t ), R(t ) ≤ ˆR(t ) ≤ τ e p(t−˜t )v4(t − ˜t ), V (t ) ≤ ˆV (t ) ≤ τ e p(t−˜t )v5(t − ˜t ), t ≥ ˜t .
From Lemma 2.3.1, we know that if R0 < 1 if and only if ρ(ΦF−V (T )) < 1. Since ρ(ΦF−V+ηm (T )) is continuous for all small η, we can choose all small η > 0 such that ρ(ΦF−V+ηm (T )) < 1. Therefore, we obtain p < 0. This means that the following limits are true.
lim lim lim lim lim t→∞E (t ) = 0, t→∞IN (t ) = 0, t→∞IC (t ) = 0, t→∞R(t ) = 0, t→∞V (t ) = 0.
For the ﬁrst equation of model (1), it is easy to prove that limt→∞S(t ) = Λ d holds. , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) of model (1) is Therefore, the disease-free periodic solution P0 = ( Λ d globally asymptotically stable. A numerical simulation of the global asymptotic stability of the disease-free peri- (cid:9)(cid:10) odic solution P0 of model (1) is given in “Appendix A,” as shown in Fig. 14.
2.5 Uniform Persistence of the Disease
In this section, we demonstrate the uniform persistence of model (1) by using uniform persistence theory of the periodic epidemic model in Zhao (2017). First, we give the following symbols:

Let X be a metric space, f : X → X be a continuous map, and X0 ⊂ X be an open set. Deﬁne
: X → X be a continuous map, and X0 ⊂ X be an
(cid:7) . ∂ X0 := X\X0, M∂ := (cid:6) x ∈ ∂ X0 : f n(x) ∈ ∂ X0, n ≥ 0
Assume that A∂ is a maximal compact invariant set of f in ∂ X0, that is, A∂ is compact, invariant, possibly empty, and contains every compact invariant subset of ∂ X0. Then a ﬁnite sequence M1, . . . , Mk of disjoint, compact, and invariant subsets of ∂ X0, each of which is isolated in ∂ X0.
Lemma 2.5.1 [see Theorem 1.3.1 in Zhao (2017)] Assume that f (X0) ⊂ X0 and f has a global attractor A;
(C1) f (X0) ⊂ X0 and f has a global attractor A; (C2) The maximal compact invariant set A∂ = A ∩ M∂ of f in ∂ X0, possibly empty, admits a Morse decomposition M1, . . . , Mk with the following properties:
(a) Mi is isolated in X. (b) W s (Mi ) ∩ X0 = ∅ for each 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
Then there exists δ > 0 such that for any compact internally chain transitive set L with L (cid:18)⊂ Mi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k, we have inf x∈L d(x, ∂ X0) > δ, that is to say f : X → X is uniformly persistent with respect to (X0, ∂ X0).
Theorem 2.5.1 If R0 > 1, then there is at least one positive periodic solution for model (1), and there is a positive constant ε > 0 such that the solution (S(t ), E (t ), IN (t ), IC (t ), R(t ), V (t )) with initial value condition (S(0), E (0), IN (0), IC (0), R(0), V (0)) ∈ R+ × I nt (R5+) for each of model (1) satisﬁes t→∞ inf(E (t ), IN (t ), IC (t ), R(t ), V (t )) ≥ (ε, ε, ε, ε, ε).
lim t→∞ inf(E (t ), IN (t ), IC (t ), R(t ), V (t )) ≥ (ε, ε, ε, ε, ε).
Proof Deﬁne X = {(S, E , IN , IC , R, V ) ∈ R6+}, X0 = {(S, E , IN , IC , R, V ) ∈ R+ × I nt (R5+)}, and ∂ X0 = X\X0. Let u(t , x0) be the unique solution of model (1) with an initial value of x0 := (S0, E0, IN 0, IC 0, R0, V0). Let f : X → X be the Poincar´e map associated with model (1); that is,
(13)
f (x0) = u(T , x0), ∀x0 ∈ X ,
where T represents the period, and u(T , x0) is the only solution of model (1) that satisﬁes u(0, x0) = x0. Obviously, by Lemma 2.2.1, we know that the solution of model (1) is uniformly f f bounded, which means that is the point dissipative on X. And, : X → X is compact. From the conclusion of Theorem 1.1.3 in Zhao (2017), we can see that f has a global attractor A. Below we let
(cid:7) . M∂ = (cid:6) (S0, E0, IN 0, IC 0, R0, V0) ∈ ∂ X0 : f n (S0, E0, IN 0, IC 0, R0, V0) ∈ ∂ X0, ∀n ≥ 0
123
73 Page 14 of 36 S.-L. Jing et al. Next, we prove that M∂ = {(S, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) : S ≥ 0} holds. Obviously, we can get
Next, we prove that M∂ = {(S, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) : S ≥ 0} holds. Obviously, we can get (S, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) ∈ M∂ for S ≥ 0. Assume that at least one of E, IN , IC , R and V is positive for the initial value (S, E , IN , IC , R, V ) = M∂. Then the following inequality is established.
(cid:24) (cid:25) t (cid:11) (cid:12) −(σ+d)t S(τ ) E (t ) = e e(σ+d)τ dτ > 0,∀t ≥ 0, β(τ )(θ IC (τ ) + IN (τ )) + ρ(τ )V (τ ) E0 + (cid:23) 0 (cid:24) (cid:25) t −(γ2+d+κ)t (1 − δ)σ E (τ )e(γ2+d+κ)τ dτ > 0,∀t ≥ 0, IN (t ) = e IN 0 + (cid:23) 0 (cid:24) (cid:25) t (cid:11) (cid:12) −(γ1+d)t e(γ1+d)τ dτ > 0,∀t ≥ 0, IC (t ) = e δσ E (τ ) + κ IN (τ ) IC 0 + (cid:23) 0 (cid:25) (cid:24) t (cid:12) (cid:11) −(q+d)t R(t ) = e e(q+d)τ dτ > 0,∀t ≥ 0, R0 + (cid:23) γ1 IC (τ ) + γ2 IN (τ ) 0 (cid:25) (cid:24) t (cid:11) (cid:12) −U t α eU τ dτ > 0,∀t ≥ 0, V (t ) ≥ e IC (τ ) + IN (τ ) V0 + (cid:23) 0
(cid:8) (cid:9) where U = min μ(t ),∀t ≥ 0 . Therefore, there is (S(t ), E (t ), IN (t ), IC (t ), R(t ), V (t )) /∈ ∂ X0 for a sufﬁciently small t > 0, we get (S(t ), E (t ), IN (t ), IC (t ), R(t ), V (t )) /∈ M∂. This means that (S0, E0, IN 0, IC 0, R0, V0) /∈ ∂ X0, (S0, E0, IN 0, IC 0, R0, V0) /∈ M∂. Consequently, we can get M∂ = {(S, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) : S ≥ 0} by the above proof. , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is globally asymptotically By Theorem 2.4.1, we know that P0 = ( Λ d stable in set M∂. Therefore, A∂ = {( Λ , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)} is the maximal compact invariant d set of f in ∂ X0. It is obvious that A∂ can be acyclic and isolated in set ∂ X0. In the following, we prove that W s (A∂ ) ∩ X0 = ∅ and A∂ is isolated in set X. For convenience, we denote x0 = (S0, E0, IN 0, IC 0, R0, V0) ∈ X0. It is known from the continuous dependence of solutions with respect to initial values that there exists  > 0 such that for all (S0, E0, IN 0, IC 0, R0, V0) ∈ X0 with (cid:11)x0 − P0(cid:11) ≤ . Further, we have
(cid:11)u(t , x0) − u(t , P0)(cid:11) ≤ ε, ∀ε > 0, ∀t ∈ [0, T].
We now claim that
lim sup n→∞ d( f n(x0), P0) ≥ ,
where d(x, y) represents the distance between x and y. Using the counter-evidence method, we assume that the following formula holds.
lim sup n→∞ d( f n(x0), P0) < , for some x0 ∈ X0.
Without loss of generality, we assume that d( f n(x0), P0) <  for any n > 0. By the continuous dependence of solutions with respect to initial values, it is known that

(cid:14) where t = t (cid:14)+ N T , t (cid:14) ∈ [0, T] and N = [ t ]. Thus, this means that there exists T > 0 T − ε ≤ S(t ) ≤ Λ such that Λ + ε, 0 ≤ E (t ) ≤ ε, 0 ≤ IN (t ) ≤ ε, 0 ≤ IC (t ) ≤ ε, d d (cid:14) 0 ≤ R(t ) ≤ ε and 0 ≤ V (t ) ≤ ε for t > T . And, we also obtain

We can represent system (14) as follows

According to Lemma 2.4.1, we know that there is a positive T -periodic func- ∗ tion v∗(t ) such that e p t v∗(t ) is a solution of system (14), where v∗(t ) = ∗ = 1 (v∗ (t ), v∗ (t ), v∗ (t ), v∗ (t ), v∗ (t )) and p 1 2 3 4 5 T ln ρ(ΦF−V−εm (T )). Note that ρ(ΦF−V−εm (T )) > 1. Therefore, according to the comparison principle, we obtain limt→∞(E (t ), IN (t ), IC (t ), R(t ), V (t )) = (∞,∞,∞,∞,∞), which is contradic- tory to 0 ≤ E (t ) ≤ ε, 0 ≤ IN (t ) ≤ ε, 0 ≤ IC (t ) ≤ ε, 0 ≤ R(t ) ≤ ε and 0 ≤ V (t ) ≤ ε. Therefore, W s (A∂ ) ∩ X0 = ∅ is proved, and A∂ is isolated in X. By

Lemma 2.5.1, f is uniformly persistent with respect to (X0, ∂ X0). Thus, the solution of model (1) is uniformly persistent. Next, we prove the existence of a positive T -period solution of model (1), that is, ∗ ∗ ∗(0), E ∗(0), I (0), I (0), R ∗(0), V f has a ﬁxed point. We consider (S ∗(0)) ∈ X0, N C ∗ ∗ ∗(0) ≥ 0, E ∗(0) > 0, I (0) > 0, I (0) > 0, R ∗(0) > 0 it is easy to see that S N C ∗(0) > 0. We now prove that S ∗(0) > 0. Using the counter-evidence method, and V ∗(0) = 0, the ﬁrst equation of model (1) is expressed as follows assuming S
∗(t ) dS ≥ Λ − (β(t )(θ IC + IN ) + ρ(t )V + d)S = Λ − (a(t ) + d)S, dt where a(t ) = β(t )(θ IC + IN ) + ρ(t )V . We can get
where a(t ) = β(t )(θ IC + IN ) + ρ(t )V . We can get
(cid:26) (cid:27) (cid:10) t t (cid:10) τ2 −(d+a(τ1))dτ1 0 0 S S ∗(t ) ≥ e ∗(0) + (cid:23) Λe (d+a(τ1))dτ1dτ2 0 (cid:23) (cid:10) t t (cid:10) τ2 −(d+a(τ1))dτ1 0 0 Λe = e (d+a(τ1))dτ1dτ2, ∀t ≥ 0. 0
Therefore, the following inequality can be obtained.
(cid:23) (cid:10) nT nT (cid:10) τ2 −(d+a(τ1))dτ1 0 0 S ∗(nT ) ≥ e Λe (d+a(τ1))dτ1dτ2 > 0. 0 ∗(0) = S ∗(nT ) = 0, n = 1, 2, 3 . . .,
From the periodicity of S ∗(t ), we know that S ∗(0) = S ∗(nT ) = 0, n = 1, 2, 3 . . ., ∗(nT ) > 0. Thus, we obtain S ∗(0) > 0. which is inconsistent with S ∗ ∗ ∗(0), E ∗(0), I (0), I (0), R ∗(0), V ∗(0))) ∈ From the above proof, we obtain that u(t , (S N C ∗ ∗ ∗(t ), E ∗(t ), I (t ), I (t ), R ∗(t ), V ∗(t )) is the positive T -period solu- I nt (R6+), and (S N C tion of model (1). A numerical simulation of the positive T -period solution for model (1) is given in (cid:9)(cid:10) “Appendix A,” as shown in Fig. 15.
3 A Case Study
In this section, we estimate the unknown parameters of model (1) on the basis of the inﬂuenza data in Gansu Province of China from January 2012 to May 2019 by using MCMC algorithm. By estimating the unknown parameters, we estimate the mean and conﬁdence interval of the basic reproduction number R0. In addition, we also estimate unreported cases.
3.1 Data Sources
The inﬂuenza case data come from the Gansu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2019), which is a public health agency in Gansu Province. The data include the number of inﬂuenza treated monthly between January 2012 and May 2019,

The gray area indicates December, January, and February each year. a The purple line indicates the monthly average temperature in Gansu Province from January 2012 to December 2018; b The blue line indicates the monthly average relative humidity in Gaolan County, Gansu Province, from January 2012 to December 2018; c The green line indicates the monthly total precipitation in Gansu Province from January 2012 to December 2018; d The deep red line indicates the monthly total sunshine time in Gansu Province from January 2012 to December 2018 (For an explanation of the reference to color in this illustration,the reader is referred to the Web version of this article) (Color ﬁgure online)
as indicated by the red histogram in Fig. 2. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that December, January and February are the high incidence of inﬂuenza. The monthly average temperature (MAT), monthly total precipitation (MTP), and monthly total sunshine time (MTST) can be obtained from the Gansu Provincial Bureau of Statistics (2019), as shown in Fig. 2a, c and d. From the National Bureau of Statistics of China (2019b), we can obtain the monthly average relative humidity (MARH) in Gaolan County, Gansu Province , as shown in Fig. 2b.
3.2 Data Analysis and Fitting

January 2012 to December 2018. We use Python software to calculate the correlation between the four sets of data, as shown in Fig. 3a. The conclusion reveals a signiﬁcant correlation between inﬂuenza and meteorological factors in Gansu Province. All four meteorological factors are negatively correlated with the number of inﬂuenza cases, the correlation between monthly average temperature and the number of inﬂuenza cases is the strongest (r = −0.9, p < 0.01), and the correlation between monthly total sun- shine time and the number of inﬂuenza cases is the weakest (r = −0.31, p < 0.01). In particular, we ﬁnd a high correlation between monthly total precipitation and the number of inﬂuenza cases (r = −0.86, p < 0.01), and a moderate correla- tion between monthly average relative humidity and the number of inﬂuenza cases (r = −0.41, p < 0.01). Figure 3a shows that the monthly total sunshine time is weakly correlated with the number of inﬂuenza cases; therefore, the effects of monthly total sunshine time are not considered in our model. Next, we use the sine function and the cosine function to ﬁt the other three types of meteorological factors. In order
123
73 Modeling the Effects of Meteorological Factors and Unreported Cases… Page 19 of 36
to unify the measurement units of several types of meteorological factors, we unitize the data of meteorological factors. Next, we use the least squares method to ﬁt the meteorological factors, as shown in Fig. 3b–d. Figure 3b shows the ﬁtting effect of monthly average temperature; the ﬁtting func- tion is expressed as follows
(cid:21) π t − 2.0364 (cid:22) + 0.3950. (15) T (t ) = 0.6050 sin 6
Figure 3c shows the ﬁtting effect of monthly average relative humidity; the ﬁtting function is expressed as follows
(cid:21) π H (t ) = 0.2600 cos t + 1.5138 (cid:22) + 0.7400. (16) 6
Figure 3d shows the ﬁtting effect of monthly total precipitation; the ﬁtting function is expressed as follows
(cid:21) π P(t ) = 0.3089 sin t + 16.7236 (cid:22) + 0.3119. (17) 6
where π/6 represents 2π /12 in Eqs. (15)–(17), that is, the period is 12 months.
3.3 Parameter Estimation and Model Fitting
We don’t have reliable data on the rate of transmission and the inﬂuenza virus, and here we only consider the rate of inﬂuenza transmission and the rate of ﬂu virus clearance. The key is to reasonably choose the functions β(t ), ρ(t ) and μ(t ). According to the periodic characteristics of inﬂuenza in Gansu Province, we deﬁne the periodic direct transmission rate between susceptible individuals and infected individuals as follows
(cid:22) (cid:21) π , t + φ β(t ) = β0 + β1 sin 6
where π/6 means 2π /12, that is, the period is 12 months, β0 and β1 indicate coefﬁcient of direct transmission rate between susceptible individuals and infected individuals, φ indicates the phase of the T -periodic function. Periodic indirect transmission rates between susceptible individuals and infected individuals are deﬁned as follows
(cid:22) (cid:21) π , t + φ ρ(t ) = ρ0 + ρ1 sin 6
where π/6 means 2π /12, that is, the period is 12 months, ρ0 and ρ1 indicate coefﬁcient of indirect transmission rate between susceptible individuals and infected individuals, φ indicates the phase of the T -periodic function. As we said in Introduction, cool and dry conditions can improve the survival rate and transmission rate of inﬂuenza virus in temperate regions (Sooryanarain and Elankumaran 2015), and the temperature decay rate of inﬂuenza virus in the environment is described as δ(T ) = αeγ T (Handel et al.
123
73 Page 20 of 36 S.-L. Jing et al.
2013), where T is the temperature and α and γ are constants. Therefore, we deﬁne the periodic clearance rate of inﬂuenza virus as follows
μ(t ) = μ0eα1T (t )+α2 H (t )+α3 P(t ),
where T (t ), H (t ) and P(t ) are both periodic functions, μ0 indicates the basic clearance rate of inﬂuenza virus, α1 indicates the trade-off factor of temperature affecting virus clearance rate, α2 indicates the trade-off factor of relative humidity affecting virus clearance rate, α3 indicates the trade-off factor of precipitation affecting virus clearance rate. In order to simulate the number of new cases of inﬂuenza in Gansu Province, the rationality of the model is veriﬁed by the number of cases actually monitored. Therefore, we mainly focus on cumulative infections and new infections every month in Gansu Province. Cumulative infection cases can be expressed as follows
dCC dCN = δσ E + κ IN , = (1 − δ)σ E − κ IN , dt dt
where CC (t ) indicates the number of cumulative infections of reported infected individuals, and CN (t ) indicates the number of cumulative infections of unreported infected individuals. As for the newly infected cases, it can be expressed as follows
(18)
(19)
PC = CC (t ) − CC (t − 1), PN = CN (t ) − CN (t − 1),
PN = CN (t ) − CN (t − 1),
where PC and PN represent the number of new cases of reported infected individuals and the number of new cases of unreported infected individuals, respectively, and t is regarded as month in the simulations. In what follows, we use Eq. (18) to ﬁt the number of new cases of reported infected individuals in Gansu Province. In the past seven years or so, many people have been infected with inﬂuenza in Gansu Province (see Fig. 4 for more accurate statistical results). In order to calculate the basic reproduction number R0 of inﬂuenza in Gansu Province and predict changes in the next few years, it is necessary to estimate the unknown parameters of model (1) since several parameters and initial values of model (1) are assigned values based on existing data and experience (see Table 2). Next, we estimate all the parameters and initial values of model (1) in detail: (i) the recruitment rate of susceptible (i.e., Λ): We obtain that the birth rate in Gansu Province at the end of 2011 is 12.08 per thousand by looking up the relevant data of the Gansu Provincial Bureau of Statistics (2019); at the same time, we also get the total population of Gansu Province at the end of 2011 is 25.813 million. Therefore, we can get a simple calculation that the monthly birth population of Gansu Province is about 25813; (ii) the natural mortality rate of the population (i.e., d): According to the statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics of China (2019a), we conclude that the monthly natural mortality rate of the population in Gansu Province in 2012 is approximately

convergence diagnostic method to evaluate chain convergence (Haario et al. 2006). We can estimate the convergence of the Markov chain by the closeness of the Geweke value to 1. The mean, standard deviation and 95% conﬁdence interval of the estimated parameters are shown in Table 2, and the ﬁtting result can be seen in Fig. 4a. It can be seen from Fig. 4a that our ﬁtting effect is good. According to the two ﬁtting curves of Fig. 4, it can be seen that inﬂuenza in Gansu Province is on an annual upward trend. In addition, we also obtain that the number of unreported inﬂuenza cases is much higher than the number of reported inﬂuenza cases. According to the parameters in Table 2, we can use the theory developed by Wang and Zhao (2008) to calculate the basic reproduction number with the periodic model (1). The basic reproduction number R0 can be calculated by Lemma 2.3.2(2), and R0 is estimated to be 1.2288 (95% CI:(1.2287, 1.2289)), as shown in Fig. 5. This means that inﬂuenza in Gansu Province is impossible to ignore. It can be seen from Fig. 5b that the basic reproduction number R0 is normally distributed. Therefore, we can easily get the conﬁdence interval and mean of R0. Furthermore, it follows from Fig. 4b that the number of inﬂuenza cases peaks when the rate of inﬂuenza virus clearance is lowest; this means that meteorological factors are the dominant factor in the seasonal outbreak of inﬂuenza.
4 Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis
As we discussed in Introduction, the periodicity of inﬂuenza in Gansu Province may be related to factors such as temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation. However, it is unclear which one is internal and the main factor. Now let us observe the respective effects of each meteorological factor.

4.1 Sensitivity of MAT to Influenza Cases and Basic Reproduction Number
According to the parameters estimated in Table 2, the number of inﬂuenza cases will decrease by 48.46% and 28.79% as the monthly average temperature (MAT) increases ◦ ◦ C and 0.25 C in December 2019, respectively. At the same time, the number by 0.5 of inﬂuenza cases will increase by 105.98% and 42.75% as the monthly average ◦ ◦ C and 0.25 C in December 2019, respectively, temperature (MAT) decreases by 0.5 as shown in Fig. 6 and Table 3. More predictions of the impact of warming measures on inﬂuenza cases in January 2020 and February 2020 are summarized in Table 3. The variation of R0 with temperature was studied by simulation. Obviously, as the monthly average temperature (MAT) increases, R0 gradually decreases, as shown in Fig. 9.

In comparison, our simulations also shows that the number of inﬂuenza cases will decrease by 10.63% and 5.40% as the monthly average relative humidity (MARH) increases by 0.5% and 0.25% in December 2019, respectively. At the same time, the number of inﬂuenza cases will increase by 12.15% and 5.91% as the monthly average relative humidity (MARH) decreases by 0.5% and 0.25% in December 2019, respec- tively, as shown in Fig. 7 and Table 4. More predictions of the impact of changing relative humidity on inﬂuenza cases in January 2020 and February 2020 are summa- rized in Table 4. The change of the basic reproduction number R0 with the monthly average relative humidity (MARH) is shown in Fig. 9. We can see that R0 gradually decreases with increasing monthly average relative humidity (MARH).

4.3 Sensitivity of MTP to Influenza Cases and Basic Reproduction Number
In order to investigate effect of monthly total precipitation (MTP) on the number of inﬂuenza cases, we ﬁnd that the number of inﬂuenza cases will decrease by 10.66% and 5.45% as the monthly total precipitation (MTP) increases by 0.5mm and 0.25mm in December 2019, respectively. At the same time, the number of inﬂuenza cases will increase by 12.23% and 5.72% as the monthly total precipitation (MTP) decreases by 0.5mm and 0.25mm in December 2019, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8 and Table 5. More predictions of the impact of changing precipitation on inﬂuenza cases in January 2020 and February 2020 are summarized in Table 5. In addition, we also ﬁnd that R0 decreases with increasing monthly total precipitation (MTP), as shown in Fig. 9. Figures 6, 7 and 8 show the number of predicted inﬂuenza individuals. It shows that an increase in the value of meteorological factors leads to a reduction in inﬂuenza indi-

viduals and then reduces the severity of inﬂuenza. This means that increasing indoor temperature and air humidity during the high season of inﬂuenza plays an important role in reducing the number of infected individuals and promoting effective disease control. For example, it is necessary to install air conditioners and air humidiﬁers indoors in winter. This is consistent with the ﬁndings of Kudo et al. (2019). In particu- lar, as can be seen from Figs. 7 and 8, we can obtain that the two meteorological factors of precipitation and relative humidity have almost the same effect on inﬂuenza, which is consistent with our experience. By comparing the data in Tables 3, 4 and 5, we obtain that temperature has a greater impact on inﬂuenza than relative humidity and precipitation, so the seasonal change in temperature is a major factor in the seasonal outbreak of inﬂuenza in Gansu Province, which is consistent with the conclusions in Lowen et al. (2007). At the same time, the effects of relative humidity and precipita- tion cannot be ignored. Then, we also note that R0 changes most signiﬁcantly under the combined action of three meteorological factors. This means that air conditioners and air humidiﬁers should be used simultaneously during periods of high inﬂuenza. In addition, we obtain that temperature is the main inﬂuencing factor of inﬂuenza, and the relative humidity and precipitation have almost the same effect on R0, which is consistent with the above conclusion.
4.4 Sensitivity of ˇ(t), (cid:2)(t) and (cid:3)(t) to Influenza Cases and Basic Reproduction Number
In order to study the effects of human-to-human contact transmission rate, human- to-pollutant contact transmission rate and inﬂuenza virus clearance rate on inﬂuenza, we investigate the changes of new cases and basic reproduction number with β(t ), ρ(t ), and μ(t ). Figure 10a–d shows the number of predicted new cases of individuals and basic reproduction number. It shows that a decrease in transmission rate or an increase in clearance rate leads to a decrease in new infections and then a reduction in the severity of inﬂuenza. This means that health precautions and environmental cleansing play an important role in reducing the number of infected individuals and

promoting effective disease control. For example, inﬂuenza patients should pay atten- tion to personal hygiene and other public health measures. In particular, as can be seen from Fig. 10c, we can obtain the impact of the environment on inﬂuenza, that is, the polluted environment greatly contributes to new infections and increases the risk of disease transmission. By comparing the blue and green curves in Fig. 10a, d with b, we obtain that the direct transmission rate has a greater impact on new cases and basic reproduction number than the indirect transmission rate. This means that the direct transmission rate has a signiﬁcant impact on inﬂuenza outbreaks and transmission.

4.5 Sensitivity of Other Parameters to Influenza Cases and Basic Reproduction Number
In what follows, we use the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and the partial rank correlation coefﬁcient (PRCC) to study the global uncertainty and sensitivity of the other parameters of the model (1) (Marino et al. 2008). According to the estimation results of the parameters in Table 2, we select a normal distribution for all input parameters, where the mean and standard deviation are given in Table 2. The values of PRCCs are calculated for multiple time points and plotted against time. This allows us to assess the importance of the parameters over the entire time period. A positive (or negative) PRCC value indicates a positive (or negative) correlation between the input parameter and the output variable. The absolute value of PRCC between 0 and 0.2 indicates that there is no signiﬁcant correlation between the input parameters and the output variables. The absolute value of PRCC between 0.2 and 0.4 indicates the moderate correlation between the input parameters and the output variables. The absolute value of PRCC between 0.4 and 1 indicates the high correlation between the input parameters and the output variables. Figure 11a and b shows 5000 sample ﬁts of the model (1) output variables PC and PN from January 2012 to May 2019. We can see that the 5000 simulations of the output variables PC and PN are periodic, which reﬂects the periodicity of inﬂuenza in Gansu Province. From Fig. 11c and d, it can be seen that the changes in several parameters over time have an impact on reported new cases and unreported new cases. In particular, there is strong negative correlation between the basic clearance rate μ0 and the number of new cases. This means that the public health department should strengthen the disinfection work. There is also strong negative correlation between the reported rate δ and the number of new cases. This means that the Gansu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention can suppress the spread of inﬂuenza by increasing the reporting rate. There is moderate negative correlation between the treatment rate κ of unreported cases and the number of new cases. This suggests that patients with inﬂuenza should go to the hospital for treatment rather than family treatment, especially in poor areas like Gansu. Then, parameters α and θ are strongly positively correlated throughout the time period. This indicates that the self-protection measures of inﬂuenza patients and the therapeutic effects of medical institutions cannot be ignored. In the case of the above LHS (Latin hypercube sampling) matrix, we evaluate the sensitivity of the output variable R0 and various input parameters (e.g., β0, β1, δ, θ, ρ0, ρ1, α, μ0, κ) by the PRCC. Figure 12a shows the sampling result of R0 by the LHS (Latin hypercube sampling) method, and Fig. 12b shows the distribution of R0 and the probability density function curve. Figure 12c shows the sensitivity of R0 to each parameter. The goal is to determine the most important parameters affecting inﬂuenza dynamics based on the basic reproduction number. Our results indicate that the parameters strongly correlated with R0 are the coefﬁcient β0 of direct transmission rate, the virus shedding rate α, the reporting rate δ, the basic clearance rate of pathogens μ0, the modiﬁcation factor θ and the coefﬁcient ρ0 of indirect transmission rate. Therefore, our results provide possible interventions to reduce inﬂuenza infections, such as reducing out-of-town and exposure during periods of high inﬂuenza inﬂuenza,

inﬂuenza patients and susceptible individuals wearing masks to reduce inﬂuenza virus transmission through droplets, the public health sector Increase coverage of inﬂuenza, and increase the frequency of disinfection in healthcare facilities. In addition, the parameters κ and R0 are moderately negatively correlated, which suggests that we should go to hospital for treatment regardless of whether the inﬂuenza is serious or not. The variation of R0 is studied by simulating the changes of parameters κ and θ, as shown in Fig. 13a. It is obvious that R0 is decreasing as the parameter κ increases and θ decreases. Note that the number of treatments for inﬂuenza patients reﬂects an increase in parameter κ, while the treatment effect in the health sector reﬂects a decrease in parameter θ. The variation charts of R0 with parameters α and μ0 show that the increase in parameter α and the decrease in parameter μ0 lead to the increase

5 Conclusion and Discussion
In this paper, in order to study the dynamic relationship among meteorological fac- tors, unreported cases and inﬂuenza, we propose a new non-autonomous differential equation model (1) with meteorological factors and unreported cases. The basic repro- duction number is obtained. The global asymptotic stability of the disease-free periodic solution is proved. The existence of the periodic solution and the uniformly persistence of model (1) are also derived. We use the MCMC algorithm to estimate the unknown

parameters and initial values of model (1) on the basis of the inﬂuenza data in Gansu province, China. The uncertainty and sensitivity of all parameters are evaluated by using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and the partial rank correlation coefﬁcient (PRCC). Through the mean and conﬁdence intervals of the parameters in Table 2, we obtain the basic reproduction number R0 = 1.2288 (95% CI:(1.2287, 1.2289)), which means that inﬂuenza is still pandemic in the crowd. The sensitivity of the parameters provides a possible intervention to reduce inﬂuenza infection. Infected individuals and suscep- tible individuals should wear masks or reduce their outings to reduce the spread of inﬂuenza viruses through droplets during inﬂuenza outbreaks (i.e., reducing the value of the parameters β(t ) and α). Susceptible individuals and recovery individuals should reduce exposure to contaminated items by wearing gloves (i.e., reducing the value of the parameter ρ(t )). Public health departments should increase the reporting rate for inﬂuenza patients (i.e., increasing the value of the parameter δ). The therapeutic effect of medical institutions should be improved (i.e., reducing the value of the parame- ter θ). The hospital should disinfect contaminated items during the high season of inﬂuenza (i.e., the more the value of the parameter μ0). In particular, unreported inﬂuenza patients should go to the hospital for treatment rather than staying at home for treatment (i.e., increasing the value of the parameter κ). In addition, our results show that inﬂuenza is more likely to spread in winter in Gansu. When relative humidity, temperature and precipitation reduce, the incidence and mortality of inﬂuenza rise. Therefore, we know that relative humidity, tempera- ture and precipitation are the main factors in the outbreak of inﬂuenza in winter in Gansu. The use of humidiﬁers and air conditioners in hospital, school or home can increase humidity and temperature, which means can reduce the risk of transmission of inﬂuenza. It follows from Fig. 4a that the number of inﬂuenza cases is increasing every year in Gansu. Some reasons may bring this phenomenon, such as air pollution, travel

frequency, and population migration. Then considering the effect of these factors and exploring the occurrence of increasing inﬂuenza cases every year should be interesting, and we leave these work for future.
