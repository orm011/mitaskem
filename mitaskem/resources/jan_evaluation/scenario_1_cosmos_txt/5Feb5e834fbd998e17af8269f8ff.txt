government in mainland China excluding Hubei province are indeed eﬀective and magniﬁcently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show
magniﬁcently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. By calculating the eﬀective reproduction ratio, we prove that the
contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April,

2020. Conclusions: To ensure the epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep suﬃcient personal protection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by April in mainland China apart from Hubei province.

China in the ﬁrst half of January with the estimation of R0 2.56. Considering the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, Zhao et al. ([9]) modelled the epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases, in mainland China from January 10 to January
from 2.24 to 3.58 associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. Li et al. ([10]) conducted a mathematical modeling study using ﬁve independent methods to assess R0 of COVID-19. Their results illustrated that R0 dropped from 4.38 to 3.41 after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a R0 of 3.39. Moreover, Tang et al. formulated a deterministic compartmental model. Their estimations based on likelihood and model analysis showed that R0 with control measures might be as high as 6.47 ([5]). Most recently, Chen et al. ([11]) developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model to simulate the potential transmission from the infectious sources to human. The estimated values of R0 were 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person. We noticed that the estimations of R0 in varied studies are diﬀerent. As mentioned in [5, 12], variability in the estimation of the basic reproduction number is a general recognized methodological issue, and standardized methods both for calculating and reporting R0 are still missing. Furthermore, the value of R0 may vary with key clinical parameters inferred from data which depend on the time period, quality, accuracy, and reliability. To better quantify the evolution of the interventions, Tang et al. ﬁtted the previously proposed model in [5] to the data available until January 29th, 2020 and re-estimated the eﬀective daily reproduction ([13]). There are also some literatures focusing on the prediction of COVID-19 development trend. Wang et al. formulated a complex network model and analyzed the possible time node and
a novel deterministic COVID-19 transmission model. We parameterize the model using data obtained until February 27th, 2020 in
number as well as the eﬀective daily reproduction ratio of the disease transmission. The population was grouped into various compartments, namely susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious with symptoms (I), infectious but asymptomatic (A), iso- lated susceptible (Si), quarantined infected pending for conﬁrmation (Q), hospital- ized (H), and recovered (R). We assume that recovered individuals have immunity at least during this epidemic period. Let N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + A(t) + R(t) be the total number of individuals in the free community. In order to ﬁt the data, we
the total number of individuals in the free community. In order to ﬁt the data, we explicitly generated additional two groups, i.e. the cumulative number of recovered Rh(t) and dead cases D(t) from hospital . The total number of cumulative reported
cases is set to be T (t). All the state variables are summarized in Table 1. ⟨ Table 1 is near here ⟩ Due to the travel restriction, migrations from/to Hubei province and other regions are ignored. Birth and nature death are also neglected.
are ignored. Birth and nature death are also neglected. With the increasing of cumulative number of conﬁrmed cases, the probabil- ity of contact transmission among the informed susceptible populations would certainly reduce ([17, 18, 19], etc.). To better quantify the varied interventions and self-protection measures, we assume the contact rate to be time-dependent c(t) = q1(t)c0, where c0 is the initial contact rate and q1(t) is the intervention (cid:0)(cid:14)T (t), which is coeﬃcient with respect to contact. Here we assume that q1(t) = e dependent on the total number of cumulative conﬁrmed cases T (t) and is monotone

We used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to ﬁt the model. The algorithm is run for 110,000 iterations with a burn-in of the ﬁrst 80,000 iterations, and the Geweke convergence diagnostic method is employed to assess convergence of chains. At the signiﬁcance level of 5%(the critical value of z is 1.96), all parameters and initial values estimated do not reject the original hypothesis of convergence to a posterior

Simulations The population of mainland China excluding Hubei province is around 1,336,210,000 [23], which can be set to be the value of S(0). 21 conﬁrmed cases were reported
on January 20th, 2020 for the ﬁrst time and the numbers of recovered and dead individuals were both 0. It can be assumed that nobody has been traced by contact tracing at the beginning. Therefore, we set Si(0) = Q(0) = Rh(0) = D(0) = 0, and H(0) = T (0) = 21. The quarantined susceptible individuals were isolated for 14 days, thus µ = 1/14 [2]. According to [6], the incubation period of COVID-19 is about 5.2 days, thus ϕ can be set to be 1/5.2.

should closely follow the total number of I(t) and R(t). Figure 4 (d) displays that the number of infectious individuals has been decreasing gradually since the end of January. However, it will not descent down to 1 until late March, which infers that
protect before April. ⟨ Figure 5 is near here ⟩ Using the estimated parameter values and the expression of the eﬀective repro- duction ratio Re(t), the threshold value of the intervention coeﬃcient with respect to contact, q1, can be calculated, which is 0.3. This implies that in order to block the continuous spread of the virus, the value of q1 must be less than 0.3 to guarantee Re(t) is below 1. In other words, the contact rate should be kept below 30% of the normal level. To examine the impact of partial lifting control measures on disease transmission, we plot the predicted time series of the number of cumulative conﬁrmed cases, T (t), and the number of the infectious individuals, I(t)+A(t), with diﬀerent contact rates (Figure 6). Assuming that the adjusting time is from March 5th, 2020, Figure 6 (a) and (b) illustrate that contact rate with 20% of the initial value c0 will not cause the disease re-bounce. However, the epidemic period will be extended for about 40 days until early May and the cumulative number of conﬁrmed cases will increase by around 0.5% to 13227. While if the starting time of the adjusting is postponed to March 20th, the epidemic time of disease will be extended for about one week and the cumulative number of conﬁrmed cases will increase by only around 0.05% to
the cumulative number of conﬁrmed cases will increase by only around 0.05% to 13161, compared with the scenario of no changes. Nevertheless, if the contact rate is half of the initial value, i.e. q1 = 0.5 and Re(t) = 1.68, COVID-19 will re-bounce
should be kept below 30% of the normal level and the lower the better. The forecasts presented are based on the assumption that there are no imported cases from Hubei and other infected regions. The WHO recently upgraded the global
as South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, etc. Although the current endemic situation in China is under control, population migration cross country border should be taken
into consideration when we modify the updated controlling policy of COVID-19.
into consideration when we modify the updated controlling policy of COVID-19. With the development of the epidemic situation in other countries in the world, it is very important to maintain and strengthen the quarantine of entry personnel. The impact of international mobility on the transmission of COVID-19 will be studied in our future works. We concentrated on the epidemic situation in mainland China excluding Hubei province is due to the signiﬁcant diﬀerences between Wuhan, Hubei, and the rest of the country. In Wuhan, Hubei, the origin of the new emerging disease COVID-19, it took much longer time to recognize and understand the disease transmission than other regions. It requires certain time from unknown to known. Therefore, the data accuracy in Wuhan, Hubei is a major issue for parameters’ calibration. In addition, the sudden large outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei exhausted all medical resources in a short time. A more targeted model considering medical resource capacity will be anticipated in the future.
Conclusions In conclusion, to ensure the COVID-19 epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated control intervention and self-protection measures,
