testing for the presence of the viral RNA at a global scale. We take advantage of the novel "natural experiment" 10 where diverse nations and major subnational regions implemented various policies including social distancing 11
and  vaccination  at  different  times  with  different  levels  of  stringency  and  adherence.  Initially,  case  numbers 12

expanding  exponentially  with  doubling  times  of  ~1-2  weeks.  In  the  nations  where  lockdowns  were  not

implemented  or  ineffectual,  case  numbers  increased  exponentially  but  then  stabilized  around  102-to-103  new
infections  (per  km2  built-up  area  per  day).  Dynamics  under  strict  lockdowns  were  perturbed  and  infections 15 decayed to low levels. They rebounded following the lifting of the policies but converged on an equilibrium 16

setpoint. Here we deploy a mathematical model which captures this behavior, incorporates a direct measure of
setpoint. Here we deploy a mathematical model which captures this behavior, incorporates a direct measure of 17 18 lockdown efficacies, and allows derivation of a maximal estimate for the basic reproductive number Ro (mean 1.6-1.8). We were able to test this approach by comparing the approximated "herd immunity" to the vaccination 19 coverage  observed  that  corresponded  to  rapid  declines  in  community  infections  during  2021.  The  estimates 20 21 reported here agree with the observed phenomena. Moreover, the decay rates d (0.4-0.5) and rebound rates r0 (0.2- 0.3) were similar throughout the pandemic and among all the nations and regions studied. Finally, a longitudinal 22 analysis comparing multiple national and regional results provides insights on the underlying epidemiology of 23 SARS-CoV-2 and lockdown and vaccine efficacy, as well as evidence for the existence of an endemic steady state 24 of COVID-19. 25 Keywords: COVID-19, epidemiology, infection dynamics, mathematical modeling 26 27 NOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.

undoubtedly curbed viral expansion [5]. However, the underlying biological, environmental and social dynamics 38 were  not  fundamentally  modified,  and  viral  circulation  was  only  temporarily  inhibited.  National  vaccination 39
programs deployed during 2021 were also aimed to block person-to-person infection. These interventions were

enacted at different times, with different levels of enforcement, compliance and extent among nations and in major 41 regions within nations. This global "natural experiment" makes the COVID-19 pandemic a unique opportunity to 42 longitudinally model epidemiological dynamics. 43 COVID-19 modeling is primarily based on the standard SIR model as the foundational tool of mathematical 44
COVID-19 modeling is primarily based on the standard SIR model as the foundational tool of mathematical 44 epidemiology and attempts to capture the main characteristics of the complex interplay among the virus, its host 45 and the environment [6]. The theoretical SIR model's solution converges on a logistic-like s-curve trajectory with 46 rapid expansion reaching a peak and declining in one wave [7]. Many much more elaborate models were deployed 47 to  study  COVID-19  dynamics  [8,9];  however,  complexity  invokes  problems  such  as  overfitting,  global 48 optimization, and interpretability. An important feature not reproduced in these models is the existence of a non- 49



trivial equilibrium setpoint. 50 51 A  key  criterion  of  epidemic  expansion  is  the  basic  reproductive  number  (Ro)  which  represents  a  disease's transmissibility. Specifically, it is the average number of productive secondary infections arising from one active 52 infectious individual [10]. It is derived from the ratio between the infection and removal rate constants in the SIR 53

54 or similar models [11]. A bifurcation threshold condition for the occurrence of a sustained epidemic is Ro≥1, 55 meaning that as Ro<1 the infection will converge on the disease-free state. This is also an indication for "herd 2
beyond the scope of this paper. While these measure changes in infection rates change over time (e.g., the first 66
derivative) they do not capture the underlying fundamental biological and social interactions. 67 This paper highlights applicability of mathematical models based on the viral dynamics paradigm [23–25]. A 68

This paper highlights applicability of mathematical models based on the viral dynamics paradigm [23–25]. A 68 notable  characteristic  of  these  models  is  a  non-trivial  non-zero  infection  dynamical  steady  state  equilibrium 69 setpoint. Further, they represent effects of interventions to block transmission of the pathogen throughout the 70 population. The major advantage of this methodology is the ability to derive estimations for the values of model 71 parameters directly from the data [26]. 72 We  refrain  from  exploring  the  dynamics  of  the  COVID-19  virus  itself.  SARS-CoV-2,  the  virus  that  causes 73 COVID-19, keeps changing and accumulating mutations in its genetic code. Some variants emerge and disappear, 74


while others emerge, spread, and replace previous variants. For the USA, for example, variant proportions are 75 tracked at https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions. Obviously, the strategies for suppression 76 can interact with the evolution of the virus. We simply assume a virus able to evolve so that it can reinfect 77
previously infected individuals. 78 Publicly available data for COVID-19 were used to characterize the epidemiological dynamics of community 79 infection. The implementation of efficacious social distancing and lockdown interventions instituted across many 80 nations allows the modeling of the dynamics of infection decay and subsequent rebound as interventions were 81
lifted or lose effectiveness. A longitudinal comparison among nations and major subnational regions provides 82 insights into pathogenesis that would be difficult or impossible to obtain in past pandemics. 83 3
extremely noisy data (up to an order-of-magnitude between days). Therefore, weekly averages were adopted here 93 and calculated from the geometric mean of the daily measurements to stabilize the variance in the data [28]. 94
There is clearly a delay between time of infection and reporting. Incubation times for COVID-19 are 6.2 days and


the mean generation interval is 6.7 days, with a concurrent latent period of 3.3 days [29]. Further, there is a lag


the mean generation interval is 6.7 days, with a concurrent latent period of 3.3 days [29]. Further, there is a lag 96 between infection and detection by lab test with a skewed distribution [30,31]. While the exact value is unknown, 97 it will only offset the data in time and does not affect the shape of the infection trajectories. Therefore, a ten-day 98 delay is applied here to all confirmed case numbers, only shifting them left in time and not affecting the shape of 99 the data. 100 Inclusion criteria 101

Analyses were performed for nations and major subnational regions with 10-fold mean difference between PCR 102 tests and positive confirmed cases, high GDP (PPP) per capita [32] indicating the ability to perform an extensive 103 testing program, and approximately one log decrease in infections from peak to minimum rates during lockdowns. 104 The forty-five units qualifying are 24 European nations, Australia and New Zealand, the UK and the four nations 105

infected individuals at rate pI and are inactivated at rate cV. These assumptions lead to the coupled nonlinear 122 ordinary differential equations: 123 dS 124 (1 ( )) t VS       dt dI (1) 125 (1 ( )) t VS I       dt dV 126 pI cV   dt 127 Intervention efficacy to block infection, via lockdowns or vaccination, is parameterized here by (t). Assuming 128 partial and incomplete effectiveness, e.g. 0<<1, the system will converge on a new lower steady state. The mean 129 infectious time is 1/. The average number of virus particles produced during the infectious interval of a single infected person (the burst size) is given by p/c. While asymptomatic carriers are thought to be efficient spreaders, 130 they are neglected here, and we assume as a first approximation that their dynamics are similar with I and change 131 in tandem with the confirmed cases. 132 Sustained viral propagation ensues if, and only if, the average number of secondary infections that arise from one 133 productively infected person is larger than one (1). This is the basic reproductive number and for Eq. (1) it is 134 135 defined by Ro=p/(c). The intrinsic growth rate constant, r, is solved for by the dominant root of the equation 136 r2+(+c)r+c(1−Ro). However, if c>> and r, then it can be simplified to: r=(Ro−1). When Ro>1, then infection rates will initially experience an exponential increase [41]. 137 5

with no loss of generality for the major trajectories of infection dynamics [43]. The model dynamics are shown 149 in Figure 1. This functional form has the advantage to decrease model complexity, especially because the viral 150 compartment is less relevant at the community-scale. Exponential decay under interventions to block infection is 151 152 given by r0=−(1−)'S0, where S0 are the number of susceptibles at t0. Under highly efficient interventions, i.e.,


153 →1, then a minimal estimate for  can be derived directly from the observed decay half-life of t½=ln(2)/ [44,45]. 154 When social interventions  are  withdrawn  or vaccines become  ineffectual at time  t1, infections rebound at an 155 exponential rate given by r='S1−, where S1 is the level of available susceptibles at t1. Crucially, r can be obtained 156 directly from the observed slope on the semi-log graph, and its doubling-time is t2=ln(2)/r. This expansion in infections will continue in damped oscillations returning to the steady-state. 157 158




Figure 1. Epidemiological dynamics under interventions to block infection. Initially, infections rise exponentially 159 (though national COVID-19 testing programs were also ramping up). During stringent lockdown and effective 160 161 cessation of viral transmission, between t0 and t1, infection decays exponentially with a half-life of t½=ln(2)/r0,



162 where r0 is derived from the slope of the ln-transformed infection data. This provides a minimal estimate for the 163 value of parameter , assuming partial intervention efficacy (0<<1). This decay will decelerate reaching a lower steady state. Infections will naturally rebound upon lifting of interventions and/or loss of vaccine efficacy with a 164 6

The USA is composed of  distinct political  entities, with large inter-state  variation. SARS-CoV-2 surged  and 222 waned differently, peaking and ebbing at different times among the various states.

decay rates during lockdowns were significantly less rapid, leading to differences that will be expanded upon 229 later. Asian nations, generally, had somewhat different COVID-19 trajectories. While the initial doubling times 230

Similar patterns were observed for ten states in the USA and five nations in Asian regions. Israel implemented a 278
second lockdown in 2020 leading to infections decaying with a half-life of 1.5 weeks and subsequent rebound


lockdown, respectively. Markedly, not only were decay and rebound slopes among countries of similar magnitude, 281 but they were also similar among infection waves within countries. 282 283 Basic reproductive number (Ro) The analytical approach here contributes insight on the basic reproductive ratio for the community spread of 284 SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2. In the literature reporting on COVID-19, and other epidemics, this is approximated from the initial 285 286 exponential growth phase [14] and represents an overestimation because it ignores the / ratio. Here the "natural experiment" of the efficient impedance of viral community spread during the initial phase of the SARS-CoV-2 287 pandemic allows the use of the empirical rebound up-slope (r) and values for the recovery/removal rate constant 288
289 (). The estimates for the basic reproductive number are provided in Table 2. Using experimentally established 290 values for  (0.4-0.5) from the decay slope during interventions to block viral expansion and ranges for r (0.2- 291 0.3) leads to basic reproductive numbers ranging between 1.4-2.3, narrowing for a CI95% to 1.6-1.8. From this perspective, active COVID-19 infected individuals would generate approximately 1.7 new secondary infections, 292 on average. 293 Herd immunity and inhibition of infection by vaccination 294

In June 2021, after the large decrease in COVID-19 following national vaccination programs, COVID-19 cases 305
rebounded spontaneously. The wave was driven by the Delta variant, which became dominant. This rebound was 306 characterized by doubling times of 1.1-1.3 (Table A1). It finally reasserted levels similar to those observed prior 307 to vaccination deployment. The decay due to vaccinations and this resurgence both correspond to the trajectories 308 observed in 2020. 309 310 Discussion 311 Infection doubling times (t2) and half-life (t½) values reveal consistent rates with extremely small variance and




Infection doubling times (t2) and half-life (t½) values reveal consistent rates with extremely small variance and
narrow range, longitudinally, among all countries analyzed here (Table 1). Mean doubling times for infection 312 313 levels during the initial exponential phase of the pandemic were 1.0 weeks (CI95%: 0.5-2.0). These were quite robust with a caveat about the rate of deployment of testing regimes (see shorturl.at/hmuFN for analysis). 314 Lockdowns  were  extremely  effective  by  inhibiting  physical  contact  and  blocking  the  virus  from  circulating. 315

Lockdowns  were  extremely  effective  by  inhibiting  physical  contact  and  blocking  the  virus  from  circulating.
Countries with no effective social distancing measures rapidly reached a setpoint equilibrium state. Limiting 316 movement  of  the  population  was  related  to  lockdown  efficacy.  Restrictions  to  travel  of  45-93%  decreased 317 infection rates by 10-fold or more, leading to an exponential decay of >90% in confirmed cases. Importantly, this 318


was uncorrelated with the minimal infection numbers. More stringent lockdowns do not appear to confer further 319 inhibition to stop viral diffusion and may signify the existence of an optimum in interventions to block COVID- 320 321 19. The mean associated half-life value during lockdowns was 2.0 (CI95%: 1.7-2.39) with no statistically significant 14


parameters. Spain, Greece, and Britain (i.e., England and Wales) were areas with elevated infectivity with values 331 of 2.3, 2.0 and 2.1, respectively. An important outcome of this calculation is the elucidation of the epidemiological 332
"herd immunity" threshold. 333 During emergent pandemics, estimates of the basic reproductive number tend to be overestimated. EarlyCOVID- 334
During emergent pandemics, estimates of the basic reproductive number tend to be overestimated. EarlyCOVID- 334 335 19 studies reported very high values [49,50]. Our estimates for SARS-CoV-2's Ro vary only slightly during waves of COVID-19, which would make sense if the dynamical properties of the infection did not appreciably change, 336 and  they  are  comparable  to  historical  influenza  pandemics  [51]  and  commensurate  with  seasonal  influenza 337
outbreaks [52]. Although these estimates are substantially lower than those reported elsewhere for COVID-19, 338 they agree with some studies [53]. 339 Vaccination deployment against SARS-CoV-2 had a dramatic effect on infection rates. Confirmed cases decayed 340



exponentially  with  a  mean  half-life  value  with  similar  rates  as  during  the  social  distancing  lockdowns,  after 341 achieving the herd immunity threshold. For example, Israel with its early and rapid program experienced a half- 342 life of 1.03 weeks in confirmed cases once 45% of the population was immunized. This agrees with the prediction 343 344 given by the approximations for R0 based on Eq. (3).



344 given by the approximations for R0 based on Eq. (3). Following the achievement of herd immunity, after approximately 30 weeks, infections spontaneously rebounded 345 again as the delta-variant emerged. The observed escape trajectory was empirically equivalent to the rebound 346 trajectories following the lockdowns and with doubling times approximately every 1.2±0.3 weeks, similar to the 347
post-lockdown rebounds doubling times. Interestingly, the Delta variant emerged in every nation included here 348 15

views the infection data decomposed into their wavelet phases and modeled with the generalized multi-logistic 358 model [56]. This approach allows derivation of the saturation level of cases as well as the "characteristic time" 359
360 (t) denoting how long the infection takes to increase from 10% to 90% of its extent. While data for many nations and regions resolve neatly into a succession of waves, Israel is unusual in having excellent data for (so far) seven 361
and regions resolve neatly into a succession of waves, Israel is unusual in having excellent data for (so far) seven 361 waves of infection as well as companion data about societal responses and suppression for the first five waves. 362 Figure 6 shows the first five infection waves and their durations ranging from 4.4 to 10.6 weeks. The sequence of 363 waves suggests the extremely dynamic interaction of COVID-19, generating new variants, with the social and 364 medical  context,  including  lockdowns,  distancing,  and  vaccines.  Predicting  new  waves  remains  an  unsolved 365

To conclude, the dynamical properties of COVID-19 epidemiology are conserved with consistent kinetic patterns 371 with  little  variation  during  multiple  waves  of  infection  and  globally  among  nations  and  subnational  regions. 372
