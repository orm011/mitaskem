"Accurate predictive modeling of pandemics is essential for optimally distributing resources and setting policy. Dozens of case predictions models have been proposed but their accuracy over time and by model type remains unclear. In this study, we analyze all US CDC COVID-19 forecasting models, by first categorizing them and then calculating their mean absolute percent error, both wave-wise and on the complete timeline. We compare their estimates to government-reported case numbers, one another, as well as two baseline models wherein case counts remain static or follow a simple linear trend. The comparison reveals that more than one-third of models fail to outperform a simple static case baseline and two-thirds fail to outperform a simple linear trend forecast. A wave-by-wave comparison of models revealed that no overall modeling approach was superior to others, including ensemble models, and error in modeling has increased over time during the pandemic. This study raises concerns about hosting these models on official public platforms of health organizations including the US-CDC which risks giving them an official imprimatur and further raising concerns if utilized to formulate policy. By offering a universal evaluation method for pandemic forecasting models, we expect this work to serve as the starting point towards the development of more sophisticated models.", "postprocess_cls": "Abstract", "postprocess_score": 0.9943727255, "detect_cls": "Abstract", "detect_score": -6.1692352295}, {"pdf_name": "6261e44c2688b71135af64fc.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 1, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/6261e44c2688b71135af64fc.pdf_1_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 612.0, 792.0], "bounding_box": [139.0, 1092.0, 304.0, 1114.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Section Header", "Equation label", "Figure", "Reference text", "Page Footer", "Page Header", "Other", "Equation", "Figure Caption", "Table Note", "Table", "Abstract", "Table Caption"], "scores": [-1.7773097754, -7.8590011597, -8.8329677582, -10.9193429947, -11.3707332611, -12.476140976, -13.1091995239, -13.8199987411, -14.3754930496, -15.2107038498, -16.2915153503, -17.6854057312, -18.4270153046, -20.4816474915], "content": "Introduction", "postprocess_cls": "Section Header", "postprocess_score": 0.9993277788, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -1.7773097754}, {"pdf_name": "6261e44c2688b71135af64fc.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 1, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/6261e44c2688b71135af64fc.pdf_1_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 612.0, 792.0], "bounding_box": [137.0, 1139.0, 1348.0, 1770.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Abstract", "Reference text", "Section Header", "Page Footer", "Equation label", "Page Header", "Figure Caption", "Table Note", "Figure", "Other", "Table Caption", "Equation", "Table"], "scores": [-1.6012696028, -15.4946556091, -15.5910110474, -16.0985527039, -17.7534351349, -18.0215988159, -19.3052825928, -20.2527256012, -21.4344768524, -22.7802677155, -24.047296524, -27.1885147095, -28.3107757568, -28.6243476868], "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic (1) has resulted in at least 80.3 million confirmed cases and nearly 1 million deaths in the United States (US) alone. Worldwide, cases exceed 500 million, with at least 6 million deaths (2). The pandemic has affected every country and continues to present a major threat to global health. This has caused a critical need to study the transmission of emerging infectious diseases in order to make accurate case forecasts, especially during disease outbreaks. Case prediction models are useful for developing pandemic preventive and control methods, such as suggestions for healthcare infrastructure needs, isolation of infected persons, and contact activity tracking. Accurate models can allow better decision-making about the degree of precautions necessary for a given region at a particular time, which regions to avoid travel to and the degree of risk in various activities like public gatherings. Likewise, models can be used to proactively prepare for severe surges in cases by allocating resources such as oxygen or personnel. Collecting and presenting these models gives public health officials, and organizations such as the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC) (3), a mechanism to disseminate these predictions to the public, but risks giving them an official imprimatur, suggesting that these models were either developed by a government agency or endorsed by them. Since the start of the pandemic, dozens of case prediction models have been designed using a variety of methods. Each of these models depend on data available about cases in the US, derived from a heterogeneous system of reporting, which can vary by county and suffer from regional, temporal delays. For example, some counties may collect data over several days and make it public at once, which creates an illusion of a sudden burst of cases. In counties with less robust testing programs, the lack of data can limit modeling accuracy. These methods are not uniform or standardized between groups that perform data collection, resulting in unpredictable errors. Underlying biases in the data, such as under-reporting, can produce predictable errors in model quality, requiring models to be adjusted to predict future erroneous reporting rather than actual case numbers. Such under-reporting has been identified by serology data (4; 5). Moreover, there is no universally agreed upon system for assessing and comparing the accuracy of case prediction models. Often published models use different methods, which makes direct comparisons difficult.

In this study, we use Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) compared to the true case numbers to compare models for normalization purposes. First, we consider which models have the most accurately predicted case counts with the least MAPE. Next, we divide these models into five broad sub-types based on approach, i.e., epidemiological (or compartment) models, machine learning approaches, ensemble approaches (which are constructed from the predictions of multiple individual models), hybrid approaches, and other approaches, and compare the overall error of models using these approaches. We also consider which exclusion criteria might produce ensemble models with the greatest accuracy and predictive power. A few studies (6; 7) have compared COVID-19 case forecasting models. However, the present study is unique in several aspects. First, it is focused on prediction models of US cases and takes into consideration all CDC models that pass the set inclusion criterion. Second, since these models were uploaded in a standardized format they can be compared across several dimensions such as R0, peak timing error, percent error, and model architecture. Third, through the study, we seek to answer several unaddressed questions relevant to pandemic case modeling. These include- (1) can we establish a metric to uniformly evaluate pandemic forecasting models?

When these models are overlaid real world data, visually several features stand out. On aggregate, models tend to approach the correct peak during various waves of the pandemic. However, some models undershot, some overshot, and many lagged the leading edge of real-world data by several weeks. Direct comparison of error based on the difference from real-world data potentially excludes important dimensions of model accuracy. For example, a model that accurately predicts the time course of disease cases (but underestimates cases by 20% at any given point) might have greater utility for making predictions about when precautions are necessary when compared to a model that predicts case numbers with only a 5% error but estimates peak cases two weeks late. To assess the degree of timing error, the peak of each model was compared to the true peak of cases that occurred within the model time window. MAPE i.e., the ratio of the error between the true case count and a model\u2019s prediction to the true case count, is a straightforward way of representing the quality of predictive models and comparing between model types.

Percent error is also conceptually straightforward to understand. However, MAPE has advantages over absolute error. A model that predicts 201,000 cases when 200,000 cases occur has good accuracy but the same absolute error as a model that predicts 1100 cases when 100 occur. MAPE accounts for this by normalizing population size. We analysed the MAPE values of all models wave-wise as shown in Figure 2. The MAPE of all models was compared to two \u201cBaseline\u201d models, which represented either an assumption that case counts would remain the same as the previous week (Baseline-I) or a simple linear model following the previous week\u2019s case counts (Baseline-II). In the first wave of the pandemic in the US, \u2018Columbia_UNC-SurvCon\u2019 achieved the lowest MAPE = 14%, closely followed by \u2018USACE-ERDC_SEIR\u2019 (MAPE = 17%) and \u2018CovidAnalytics-DELPHI\u2019 (MAPE = 25%) models. Here, only 4 models performed better than both baselines. Three of these were epidemiological models while one was a hybrid model. From the t-test, on MAPE values of models categorized on the basis of model type (refer Figure 4), it can be inferred that during the first wave, hybrid models performed the best and attained the lowest MAPE. This was followed by the epidemiological models and those based on machine learning. On the other hand, ensemble models had the largest MAPE during this wave and none of them surpassed the Baseline-I MAPE, i.e., 31%. During the second wave, \u2018IQVIA_ACOE-STAN\u2019 performed the best with an MAPE score of 5% (see Figure 2). In this wave, a total of 13 models performed better than both baselines, with MAPE ranging from 5 to 37. These included 5 ensemble models, 4 epidemiological models, 2 machine learning models and 2 hybrid models. All ensemble models exceed Baseline-I performance (that had MAPE = 37%), with the exception of \u2018UVA-Ensemble\u2019. The epidemiological models showed a staggered MAPE distribution. Followed by the hybrid and the models categorized as \u2018other\u2019 model sub-types, these have the lowest average MAPE in wave-II. In contrast to wave-I, ensemble models provide the best forecasts in wave-II (see Figure 4). Here, hybrid models are the worst performing models. During wave-III (see Figure 4), ensemble models performed similarly to wave-I. Baseline models had a relatively elevated high MAPE with Baseline-I and II MAPE scores being 74% and 77% respectively. In wave-III, \u2018USC-SI_kJalpha\u2019 is the best-performed model with MAPE= 32% (see Figure 2). Here, 32 models performed better than both baseline models. These included 12 compartment models, 3 machine learning models, 4 hybrid models, 8 ensemble models, and 5 un-categorized models. In wave-IV of the pandemic, a number of models performed similarly between a MAPE of 28% and baseline of 47% (Figure 2). Ensemble models performed the best whereas epidemiological models had the highest MAPE during this wave. Baseline-I and II MAPE scores were 47% and 48% respectively. In wave-IV, \u2018LANL-GrowthRate\u2019 is the best performed model with MAPE= 28% (Figure 2). In the fourth wave, 17 models performed better than both baseline models. These included 6 compartment models, 7 ensemble models, 1 machine learning model, 2 hybrid models, and 1 uncategorized model. The MAPE values of all models over the complete timeline was also analysed (see Figure 3). Here, we find \u2018IQVIA_ACOE-STAN\u2019, \u2018USACE-ERDC_SEIR\u2019, \u2018MSRA-DeepST\u2019, and \u2018USC-SI_kJalpha_RF\u2019 achieve the best performance with low MAPE ranging from 5% to 35%. In a comparison of overall performance, ensemble models performed significantly better than all other model types (3). However the performance of ensemble models was not \u201csignificantly\u201d better than the baseline models (no change or simple linear model) which performed better than both machine learning and epidemiological models overall (4). MAPE of the top-10 performing models over all waves were examined (refer Figure 6). Though we examined 54 models overall (reported 51 in the full timeline), many of these did not make predictions during the first wave of the pandemic when data was less available and therefore do not appear in the wave-wise analysis. The number of weeks for which each model provides predictions were highly variable, as seen in Figure 7. The MAPE of models in the US-CDC database increased each week out from the time of prediction. Figure 5 depicts a strictly increasing rise in MAPE with the increase in the forecast horizon. In other words, the accuracy of predictions declined the further out they were made. At one week from the time of prediction, the MAPE of models examined clustered just below 25% MAPE and declined to about 50% MAPE by four weeks. The MAPE in each week was relatively bi-modal, with several models fitting within a roughly normal distribution and others having a higher MAPE. The distribution of the points indicates that the majority of models project similar predictions for smaller forecast horizons, while the predictions for larger horizons are more spread out. The utility of model interpretation would improve by excluding those models that fall more than one standard deviation (\u03c3) from the average MAPE of models.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9998986721, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -1.303925395}, {"pdf_name": "6261e44c2688b71135af64fc.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 4, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/6261e44c2688b71135af64fc.pdf_4_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 612.0, 792.0], "bounding_box": [1304.0, 1822.0, 1345.0, 1838.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Reference text", "Equation label", "Page Footer", "Figure", "Figure Caption", "Page Header", "Section Header", "Table Note", "Table", "Abstract", "Table Caption", "Other", "Equation"], "scores": [-0.8377676606, -2.5853946209, -3.4498345852, -4.5497021675, -4.6866750717, -5.7619643211, -5.8237013817, -5.9809513092, -6.0666332245, -6.5299301147, -6.7564229965, -8.0607891083, -8.3355302811, -9.1719646454], "content": "4/23", "postprocess_cls": "Page Footer", "postprocess_score": 0.9998586178, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -0.8377676606}, {"pdf_name": "6261e44c2688b71135af64fc.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 4, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/6261e44c2688b71135af64fc.pdf_4_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 612.0, 792.0], "bounding_box": [139.0, 1529.0, 290.0, 1550.0], "classes": ["Figure", "Section Header", "Body Text", "Page Footer", "Equation label", "Equation", "Figure Caption", "Table Note", "Other", "Table", "Reference text", "Table Caption", "Page Header", "Abstract"], "scores": [-3.8358674049, -4.1710486412, -4.8267345428, -5.2234582901, -5.7156023979, -5.8196649551, -7.1768064499, -7.9501838684, -8.0416183472, -8.1424217224, -8.1998262405, -8.2338991165, -8.6184425354, -10.2432899475], "content": "Discussion", "postprocess_cls": "Section Header", "postprocess_score": 0.9957543612, "detect_cls": "Figure", "detect_score": -3.8358674049}, {"pdf_name": "6261e44c2688b71135af64fc.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 4, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/6261e44c2688b71135af64fc.pdf_4_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 612.0, 792.0], "bounding_box": [136.0, 1575.0, 1346.0, 1770.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Figure Caption", "Reference text", "Abstract", "Page Footer", "Page Header", "Section Header", "Equation label", "Table Note", "Figure", "Table Caption", "Other", "Table", "Equation"], "scores": [-3.8067724705, -8.3892669678, -10.4077692032, -10.9818916321, -11.3693256378, -11.7455196381, -12.2493638992, -12.4723453522, -13.1372804642, -14.0449991226, -14.4198493958, -16.4981365204, -17.0078258514, -18.3749065399], "content": "Accurate modeling is critical in pandemics for a variety of reasons. Policy decisions need to be made by political entities which must follow procedures, sometimes requiring weeks for a proposed policy intervention to become law and still longer to be implemented. Likewise, public health entities such as hospitals, nurseries, and health centers need \u201clead time\u201d to distribute resources such as staffing, beds, ventilators, and oxygen supplies. However, modeling is limited, especially by the availability of data, particularly in early outbreaks (8).

For example, a case forecasting model that consistently makes predictions that fare worse than assuming that case counts will remain unchanged or that they will follow a simple linear model isn\u2019t likely to be useful in situations where modeling is critical. The use of these baselines allows for the exclusion of models that \u201cfail\u201d to predict case counts adequately. The average MAPE of successful models which we define as lower MAPE than either baseline model varied between methods depending on the wave they were measured in. In the first wave, epidemiological models had a mean MAPE of 31.11, and machine learning models had a mean MAPE of 31.97. In the second wave, these were 44.87 and 44.25 respectively. In the third wave, these were 62.5 and 63.15, and in the fourth wave, these were 91.48 and 43.58 respectively. Therefore, we notice that the mean MAPE of models got worse with each wave. This is because each model type is susceptible to changing real-world conditions, such as the emergence of new variants with the potential to escape prior immunity, or a higher R0, new masking or lockdown mandates, the spread of conspiracy theories, or the development of vaccines which will decrease the number of individuals susceptible to infection. In waves-2 and 3, the \u201cbest\u201d performing model was a hybrid and machine learning model respectively. In waves 1 and 4, the best model was an other and epidemiological model respectively. In each wave, some examples of each model type were successful, and some were unsuccessful. No model category did significantly better than baseline models except in wave-3 (Figure 4). In wave-3, compartment models were significantly better than baseline models, although ensemble models had the lowest overall MAPE. These results do not suggest that either overall modeling technique is inherently superior for predicting future case counts. Compartment (or epidemiological) models broadly use several \u201ccompartments\u201d which individuals can move between such as \u201csusceptible,\u201d \u201cinfectious,\u201d or \u201crecovered,\u201d and use real-world data to arrive at estimates for the transition rate between these compartments. However, the accuracy of a compartment model depends heavily on accurate estimates of the R0 in a population, a variable that changes over time, especially as new virus variants emerge. For example, the emergence of the Iota variant of SARS-CoV-2 (also known as lineage B.1.526) resulted in an unpredicted increase in case counts (11). Machine learning models train algorithms that would be difficult to develop by conventional means. These models \u201ctrain\u201d on real-world data sets and then make predictions based on that past data. Machine learning models are sensitive to the datasets they are trained on, and small or incomplete datasets produce unexpected results. Hybrid models make use of both compartment modeling and machine learning tools. On the other hand, ensemble models combine the results of multiple other models hoping that whatever errors exist in the other models will \u201caverage out\u201d of the combined model. Ensemble models potentially offer an advantage over individual models in that by averaging the predictions of multiple models, flawed assumptions or errors in individual models may \u201caverage out\u201d and result in a more accurate model. However, if multiple models share flawed assumptions or data, then averaging these models may simply compound these errors. An individual model may achieve a lower error than multiple flawed models in these cases. The \u201cbaseline\u201d models had a MAPE of 48 and 54 over the entire course of the pandemic in the US. Most models did not perform better than these. Among those that did, we discuss the five with the best performance (in increasing order of their performance). First, \u201cQJHong-Encounter\u201d is a model by Qijung Hong, an Assistant professor at Arizona State University. This model uses an estimate of encounter density (how many potentially infectious encounters people are likely to have in a day) to predict changes in estimated R (reproduction number), and then uses that to estimate future daily new cases. The model uses machine learning. It had a MAPE of 38 over all waves. Second, \u201cUSC-SI_kJalpha_RF\u201d is a hybrid model from the University of Southern California Data Science Lab. This model also uses a kind of hybrid approach, where additional parameters are modeled regionally for how different regions have reduced encounters, and machine learning is used to estimate parameters (12). It had a MAPE of 35 over all waves. Third, \u201cMSRA-DeepST\u201d is a SIR hybrid model from Microsoft Research Lab-Asia that combines elements of SEIR models and machine learning. It had a MAPE of 34. Next, \u201cUSACE-ERDC_SEIR\u201d is a compartment model developed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center COVID-19 Modeling and Analysis Team. It adds to the classic SEIR model, adding additional compartments for unreported infections and isolated individuals. It used Bayesian estimates of prior probability based on subject matter experts to select initial parameters. It had a MAPE of 31. Lastly, \u201cIQVIA_ACOE_STAN\u201d is a machine learning model from IQVIA-Analytics Center of Excellence and has the highest apparent performance on the overall timeframe. The calculated MAPE for this model was 5. Notably, the MAPE of 5 is much lower than the MAPE of 31 of the next closest model. Although MAPE is superior to other methods of comparing models, there are still some challenges.

Additionally, different states have heterogeneity in vaccination rate, population density, implementation of masking and lockdown, and other measures which may affect case count predictions. Therefore, the assumptions underlying different models and the degree to which this heterogeneity is taken into account may result in models having heterogeneous predictive power in different states. Although this same thinking could be extended to the county level, the case count reporting in each county is even more variable and makes comparisons difficult. To make the comparison between models more even, we used multiple times segments to represent the various waves during the pandemic. Models that have made fewer predictions, particularly avoiding the \u201cregions of interest\u201d such as a fresh wave or a peak, would only be subjected to a less challenging evaluation than the models that covered most of the timeline. Further, the utility of models with only a few predictions within \u201cregions of interest\u201d is also questionable. Considering these aspects, we define 04 time segments corresponding to each of the major waves in the US. Within each of these waves of interest, we consider only models that made a significant number of predictions for the purpose of comparison. Such a compartmentalized comparison is now straightforward, as all models within a time segment can now have a common evaluation metric. We focus on evaluating the performance of models for their 4-week ahead forecasts. A larger forecast horizon provides a higher real-world utility in terms of policy-making or taking precautionary steps. We believe this to be a more accurate representation of the predictive abilities of models as opposed to smaller windows in which desirable results could be achieved by simply extrapolating the present trend. Therefore, due to the time delays associated with policy decisions and the movement of critical resources and people, the long-term accuracy of models is of critical importance. To take an extreme example, a forecasting model that only predicted one day in advance would have less utility than one that predicted ten days in advance. The failure of roughly one-third of models in the CDC database to produce results superior to a simple linear model should raise concerns about hosting these models in a public venue. Without strict exclusion criteria, the public may not be aware that the are significant differences in the overall quality of these models. Each model type is subject to inherent weaknesses of the available data. The accuracy of compartment models is heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of reported data and also depends on a variable that might change with the emergence of new variants. Heterogeneous reporting of case counts, variable accuracy between states, and variable early access to testing resulted in limited data sets. Likewise, it seems that since training sets did not exist, machine learning models were unable to predict the Delta variant surge. Robust evidence-based exclusion criteria and performance-based weighting have the potential to improve the overall utility of future model aggregates and ensemble models.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9998437166, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": 0.3156450391}, {"pdf_name": "6261e44c2688b71135af64fc.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 7, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/6261e44c2688b71135af64fc.pdf_7_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 612.0, 792.0], "bounding_box": [1304.0, 1822.0, 1345.0, 1838.0], "classes": ["Reference text", "Equation label", "Body Text", "Page Footer", "Section Header", "Table", "Figure", "Page Header", "Figure Caption", "Equation", "Table Note", "Table Caption", "Abstract", "Other"], "scores": [-0.3472510576, -2.4043915272, -2.4322645664, -2.9272968769, -2.9314961433, -3.0764098167, -3.1027772427, -3.2847230434, -3.5789108276, -3.7492105961, -3.8295733929, -3.9109632969, -4.4614477158, -4.8325080872], "content": "7/23", "postprocess_cls": "Page Footer", "postprocess_score": 0.9996420145, "detect_cls": "Reference text", "detect_score": -0.3472510576}, {"pdf_name": "6261e44c2688b71135af64fc.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 8, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/6261e44c2688b71135af64fc.pdf_8_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 612.0, 792.0], "bounding_box": [145.0, 7.0, 1339.0, 61.0], "classes": ["Page Header", "Page Footer", "Equation label", "Reference text", "Table", "Body Text", "Equation", "Figure Caption", "Other", "Figure", "Section Header", "Table Caption", "Table Note", "Abstract"], "scores": [0.5949996114, -7.0469274521, -7.7887501717, -8.4632663727, -9.2015094757, -9.3063898087, -9.3579978943, -9.3751401901, -10.3266305923, -11.0444669724, -11.1970348358, -11.7377929688, -13.3526134491, -14.2079353333], "content": "medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.20.22274097 ; this version posted April 21, 2022.

However, globally the assumptions necessary to produce an accurate model might differ due to differences in population density, vaccine availability, and even cultural beliefs about health. However, identifying the modeling approaches that work best in the United States provides a strong starting point for global modeling. Some of the differences in modeling will be accounted for by different input data, which can be customized by country or different training sets in the case of machine learning models. The ultimate measure of forecasting model quality is whether the model makes a prediction that is used fruitfully to make a real-world decision. Staffing decisions for hospitals can require a lead time of 2-4 weeks to prevent over-reliance on temporary workers, or shortages (13). Oxygen has become a scarce resource during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also needs lead time (14). This has had real-world policy consequences as public officials have ordered oxygen imports well after there were needed to prevent shortages (15). Indeed for sufficient time to be available for public officials to enact new policies and for resources to be moved, a time frame of eight weeks is preferable. The need for accurate predictions weeks in advance is confounded by the declining accuracy of models multiple weeks in advance, especially considering the rise time of new variant waves. During the most recent wave of infections, news media reported on the potential for the \u201comicron\u201d variant of SARS-CoV-2 to rapidly spread in November of 2021, however in the United States, an exponential rise did was not apparent in case counts until December 14th, when daily new case counts approximated 100k new cases per day, and by January 14th, 2022, new cases exceed 850,000 new cases per day. The time when accurate predictive models are most useful is ahead of rapid rises in cases, something none of the models examined were able to predict, given the rise in SARS-CoV-2 cases that occurred during the pandemic. Although forecasting models have gained immense attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, many challenges are faced in developing forecasting models that serve the needs of governments and organizations. Since COVID-19 has a long incubation period of up to 14 days, identifying patients beforehand presents its own set of challenges. Patients can infect those in close contact with them throughout the virus incubation period when they may be asymptomatic and unaware that they are infected. In a real-world scenario, it is very difficult to implement a complete lockdown or define a metric for evaluating the effectiveness of a lockdown. Relating the optimal time period of the lockdown, taking into consideration the incubation period of the virus, is a complex task. The lack of clean, structured, and accurate datasets also affects the performance of the case prediction models, making the estimation of patient mortality count and transmission rate significantly harder. We found that most models are not better than CDC baselines. The benchmark for resource allocation ahead of a wave remains the identification and interpretation of new variants and strains by biologists.

The US-CDC collects weekly forecasts for COVID cases in four different horizons: 1-week, 2-weeks, 3-weeks and 4-weeks, i.e., each week, the models make a forecast for new COVID cases in each of the four consecutive weeks from the date of the forecast. The forecast horizon is the length of time into the future for which forecasts are to be prepared. In the present study, we focus on evaluating the performance of models for their 4-week ahead forecasts. The data for the confirmed case counts are taken from the COVID-19 Data Repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID- 19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us), maintained by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at the Johns Hopkins University (JHU). The data for the predicted case counts, of all the models, is obtained from the data repository for the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub), which is also the data source for the official US-CDC COVID-19 forecasting page. Both these datasets were preprocessed to remove unwanted data items. For plotting Figure 1, the Pyplot module from the Matplotlib library in Python was used. The models are categorized into five different categories- Ensemble, Epidemiological, Hybrid, and Machine Learning. The models which did not broadly fall into these categories were kept in \u2018others\u2019. These models use very different methods to arrive at predictions. We are comprehensively looking at 51 models. The CDC also uses an ensemble model, and we looked at whether this was better than any individual model. For each model uploaded to the CDC website, MAPE was calculated and reported in this study, and the models were compared wave-wise as shown in various figures. For each model, the model type was noted, as well as the month proposed. The term \u201cwave\u201d here implies a natural pattern of peaks and valleys.

Baseline-I is the \u2018CovidHub-Baseline\u2019 (or CDC\u2019s baseline), i.e., the median prediction at all future horizons is the most recent observed incidence. Baseline-II is the linear predictor extrapolation using slope of change in reported active cases between the two weeks preceding date of forecast. These baselines are included in the bar charts (shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3). Within each of the waves of interest, only models that made a significant number of predictions are considered for the purpose of comparison. We only consider models that have made predictions for at least 25% of the target dates covered by the respective time segment for all comparisons in this section. The MAPE was calculated on the four-weeks forecast horizon. Figure 3 illustrates the performance of models across all the waves. Same procedure, as in Figure 2, was followed for plotting Figure 3. The performance of all the models are compared, wave-wise and on the complete timeline based on the MAPE (or mean absolute percent error).

The mean of the MAPE values is calculated for each category in model-type, for overall and each wave separately. The mean is calculated by adding the MAPE values of all the models in a category and dividing it by the number of models in that category for the corresponding wave. Then, pairwise t-test is performed to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. We used the ttest_ind function of the statsmodels module in Python to perform the test. The statistical significance is determined by the p-value given as the output. In null-hypothesis significance testing, the p-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct. A p-value less than 0.05 (typically \u2264 0.05) is statistically significant. It indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, as there is less than 05% probability that null-hypothesis is correct. The null hypothesis is a typical statistical theory which suggests that no statistical relationship and significance exists in a set of given single observed variable, between two sets of observed data and measured phenomena. So, the bar pots having p-value less than 0.05 (statistically significant), are joined using an asterisk. In Figure 5, box-plots are made representing the MAPE over all the predictions of a certain model for the corresponding forecast horizon. A box-plot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five number summary (\u201cminimum\u201d, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and \u201cmaximum\u201d).
