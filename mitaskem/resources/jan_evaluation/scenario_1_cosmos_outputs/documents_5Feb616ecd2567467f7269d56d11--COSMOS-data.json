serious epidemic around the world, but it has been effectively controlled in the mainland of China. The Chinese government limited the migration of people almost from all walks of life. Medical workers have rushed into Hubei province to fight against the epidemic. Any activity that can increase infection is prohibited. The aim of this study was to confirm that timely lockdown, large- scale case-screening and other control measures proposed by the Chinese government were effective to contain the spread of the virus in the mainland of China. Methods: Based on disease transmission-related parameters, this study was designed to predict the trend of COVID-19 epidemic in the mainland of China and provide theoretical basis for current prevention and control. An SEIQR epidemiological model incorporating asymptomatic transmission, short term immunity and imperfect isolation was constructed to evaluate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 inside and outside of Hubei province. With COVID-19 cases confirmed by the National Health Commission (NHC), the optimal parameters of the model were set by calculating the minimum Chi-square value. Results: Before the migration to and from Wuhan was cut off, the basic reproduction number in China was 5.6015. From 23 January to 26 January 2020, the basic reproduction number in China was 6.6037. From 27 January to 11 February 2020, the basic reproduction number outside Hubei province dropped below 1, but that in Hubei province remained 3.7732. Because of stricter controlling measures, especially after the initiation of the large-scale case-screening, the epidemic rampancy in Hubei has also been contained. The average basic reproduction number in Hubei province was 3.4094 as of 25 February 2020. We estimated the cumulative number of confirmed cases nationwide was 82 186, and 69 230 in Hubei province on 9 April 2020. Conclusions: The lockdown of Hubei province significantly reduced the basic reproduction number. The large-scale case-screening also showed the effectiveness in the epidemic control. This study provided experiences that could be replicated in other countries suffering from the epidemic. Although the epidemic is subsiding in China, the controlling efforts should not be terminated before May.

The epidemic has spread rapidly across the world [3\u20135]. In China, a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported in Wu- han, Hubei province, in December 2019 [6\u20138]. Rapidly, Hubei province became the hardest-hit of the COVID-19 epidemic, due to the high rate of human-to-human trans- mission [9\u201311], mainly through droplets from coughing or sneezing or body contact. Immediately, the Chinese government took drastic controlling efforts (like public education, active surveillance, early detection, case man- agement, contact tracing, especially mandatory quarantine for at least 14 days [12]). As of 26 May 2020 (24:00 GMT + 8), 82 993 confirmed cases, 6 suspected cases and 4634 deaths were reported in China, most of them from Hubei province (68 135 confirmed cases and 4512 deaths) [13]. This epidemic is attacking 215 countries and regions around the world, such as USA, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Russian Federation, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey, Iran, Canada, Peru, India, Belgium, Netherlands and Republic of Korea. There have appeared 5 404 512 confirmed cases and 343 514 deaths worldwide until 26 May 2020 (10:00 GMT + 2) [14]. SARS-CoV-2, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the flu virus belong to the same family and cause similar symptoms [15, 16]. People of all ages are susceptible. Onset manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, cough symptoms, myalgia or fatigue, and a few or few present sputum overproduc- tion, headache, haemoptysis and diarrhea [17\u201322]. Though showing no symptoms or only mild symptoms, some patients still transmit the virus, a phenomenon that is called asymptomatic transmission [23\u201326]. No specific treatment drugs have yet been created for COVID-19 [12, 27]. COVID-19 is self-limiting, and pa- tients often heal through their immunity. Many asymp- tomatic patients can recover after self-quarantine [28]. The 2002\u20132003 SARS epidemic led to 8096 cases and 774 deaths (mortality 9.6%) in 29 countries or regions [29], and the persistent MERS epidemics led to 2494 cases and 858 deaths (mortality 34.4%) in 27 countries during 2012\u20132019 [30]. The COVID-19 epidemic has aroused global health concern [31]. Many countries im- plemented mandatory quarantine in spite of its relatively low mortality (2.8%). For instance, the government of China limited inflow and outflow of people almost from all walks of life, and suspended all kinds of mass activ- ities. But, medical workers have streamed into Hubei province to fight against the epidemic.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9999605417, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -2.4516057968}, {"pdf_name": "616ecd2567467f7269d56d11.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 2, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616ecd2567467f7269d56d11.pdf_2_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.276, 790.866], "bounding_box": [739.0, 214.0, 1308.0, 1198.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Equation label", "Reference text", "Page Footer", "Section Header", "Abstract", "Page Header", "Figure Caption", "Figure", "Table Note", "Other", "Equation", "Table", "Table Caption"], "scores": [1.8737971783, -24.9248409271, -25.2661304474, -25.6414775848, -26.3873844147, -28.0547885895, -28.9698295593, -29.0922031403, -29.478395462, -31.9102706909, -32.2519874573, -41.5417060852, -43.3139381409, -45.2823104858], "content": "Therefore, to find more effective control efforts, the peak arrival time and the trend of the COVID-19 epi- demic in the mainland of China should be predicted with a well-designed model [32, 33]. Many studies have esti- mated the reproduction number in the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak in China [32\u201343]. This study based on the cumulative confirmed cases, cured and discharged cases, death tolls and suspected cases released from the National Health Commission (NHC) [13]. These findings formulate a SEIQR (susceptible-ex- posed-infected but not hospitalized-infectious and isolated- recovered) epidemic model to explore the impacts of the lockdown of Wuhan and the curb of population migration on COVID-19 transmission. The model was constructed, incorporating asymptomatic transmission, short term im- munity and imperfect isolation. The aim of this study was to prove that timely lockdown, large-scale case-screening and other control measures proposed by the Chinese gov- ernment were effective means to contain the spread of the virus in the mainland of China. Through parameter estima- tion, we got the parameters of the model. With the aid of sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the timeliness and correct- ness of the early measures implemented by the Chinese government. Before 25 February 2020, we predicted the epidemic trend in China, and the final number of cumula- tive confirmed cases in Hubei province and the mainland of China. Up to now, the results have been proved accurate. At the same time, the basic reproduction number of each stage is decreasing, which reflects that the control measures of the Chinese government play a decisive role. Before 25 February, we also gave suggestions on the time for full re- sumption of work.

On 5 Feb- ruary 2020, NHC released the fifth edition of the Diag- nosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 [49]. On 12 February 2020, NHC advocated the large-scale case- screening of previously suspected cases and re- examination of the diagnostic results, and that the diag- nosis of COVID-19 should be based on three criteria (previously on two): a history of epidemiological contact or a history of stay in the epidemic area, clinical symp- toms (such as fever, cough) and CT features. The NHC announced 59 804 confirmed cases nationwide, including 13 332 clinically diagnosed cases on 12 February. In the next 2 days, the number rose to 63 851 (15 384 clinically diagnosed cases) and 66 492 (16 522 clinically diagnosed cases). With the release of the sixth edition of the Diag- nosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 [50], it was officially announced on February 19 that the original two standards were reused for the diagnosis. By subtracting the data of Hubei province from the national data, we obtained the cumulative case data out- side Hubei province. The study involved case data re- leased from 11 January to 25 February 2020.

According to the de- scription in the previous section, the model (1) has changed its pattern for three times. The simulation re- sults are very consistent with the actual cumulative con- firmed cases. Next, we detailed the rationality of these major controlling measures adopted by NHC and the necessity of adapting our model to a new situation. 1) If Wuhan was not locked down on 23 January, and no subsequent controlling measures were taken: We use the parameters of the first stage (11 January\u201322 January 2020) and the initial values of the model to fit the cumulative confirmed case data of Hubei province (L1(t)) and the mainland of China (L1(t) + L2(t)) (Fig. 3).

However, the lockdown of Hubei is also workable. 3) After Wuhan and Hubei were locked down, other cities in China were also locked down one after another, but the large-scale case-screening after 12 February was not initiated: Since 12 February, NHC decided to add clinically diagnosed cases to confirmed cases, resulting in a \u201cdramatic changes\u201d after 12 Febru- ary. Since 27 January (after Hubei is completely locked down), the clinically diagnosed cases, instead of the total number within the past 16 days, was reported by NHC every day. We assume that the model switches its pat- tern on 27 January, then we can get the cumulative con- firmed cases of Hubei province and the mainland of China (black dotted line) in Figs. 4 and 5 during a time when large-scale case-screening was not conducted. It can be seen that the experimental numbers are greater than the actual numbers. And we see that due to the large-scale case-screening on 12 February, the system switches its pattern again. The cumulative confirmed cases of Hubei province and the mainland of China (blue dotted line) are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Based on this conjecture, the cumulative number of confirmed cases nationwide was 82 186, and 69 230 in Hubei province on 9 April. This scenario validates the necessity of large- scale case-screening. 4) Wuhan locked down, Hubei locked down, large- scale case-screening taken: After Hubei province was locked down, we estimated that S1(17) = 3.25 \u00d7 104, large-scale S2(17) = 1.02 \u00d7 104.

The contact between sus- ceptible individuals and suspected, carrier or undetected individuals in model (1) (uniformly defined as infected but not hospitalized individuals with asymptomatic transmission) is not the main route of transmission. Al- though the transmission rate between susceptible indi- viduals and non-hospitalized patients is the biggest than that in E and Q classes, and the incubation period (1/\u03b1, average: 5.8 days) and treatment period (1/\u03b4, average: 16.18 days) are longer than the detection time (1/\u03b3, aver- age: 4.41 days). This may be explained by the larger number of exposed patients (E) than those who are not hospitalized (I). From Table 3, in the prophase of epidemic (11 Janu- ary\u201326 January), the basic reproduction numbers in the mainland of China (R0) were 5.6015 and 6.6037. These results kept consistent with those of Tang et al. (6.47 [95% CI: 5.71\u20137.23]) [33], Shen et al., (4.71 [95% CI: 4.50\u20134.92]) [34] and Jia et al. (5.6870 inside Hubei, 6.0295 outside Hubei) [32]. In the metaphase of the epi- demic (27 January\u201311 February), the basic reproduction number in Hubei was 3.7732, the average basic reproduction number was 3.4094 until 25 February. These results agreed with those of Zhao et al. (3.58 [95% CI: 2.89\u20134.39]) [35], Imai (1.5\u20133.5) [55], Read et al. (3.11 [95% CI: 2.39\u20134.13]) [56], Cao (4.08) [36], Abbott et al.

In fact, the basic reproduction number is closely related to time and region, and can reflect the se- verity of the epidemic. In particular, the number of basic reproduction num- ber in Hubei province was larger than that outside Hubei province. The number of basic reproduction number before the start of large-scale case-screening (prophase and metaphase of the epidemic) was much greater than that after the large-scale case-screening (anaphase of the epidemic). These results were consist- ent with the conclusion of Jia et al. [32], and this sug- gested that the epidemic in Hubei province was much more serious. It also could be seen that our estimated basic reproduction number before 11 February 2020 was slightly higher than that of some previous studies [15, 18, 41\u201343, 57]. This might be mainly caused by the fol- lowing two reasons. (1) When only Wuhan had con- firmed cases at the prophase of the epidemic, we assumed that the number of susceptible individuals on 11 January was the permanent population of Wuhan. With the frequent migration of the population, the epi- demic gradually spread across Hubei and China, so there was an increase in the number of susceptible persons be- fore the lockdown of Hubei.

Once the migration restarts, an increase will be observed in the number of susceptible persons and the transmission rate (\u03b21). We assume that the number of susceptible per- sons in Hubei will mutate to 10 million. Next, we pre- dicted the cumulative confirmed case at three time points (12 March, 12 April, and 12 May).

Therefore, the current controlling efforts should not be eliminated too earlier. After the epidemic rampancy is completely con- trolled, theoretically, as long as sufficient precautions are taken (the transmission rate \u03b21 is less than 0.4005 and the basic reproduction number is just less than 1), the epidemic situation will not break out again. We obtained the research results on 25 February 2020, a day on which the epidemic in China was not completely quelled, and the global pandemic had not taken shape.

Hubei province was the worst-hit area in China, espe- cially its Wuhan. The lockdown of Hubei province re- sulted in a significant reduction in the basic reproduction number.

This shows that COVID-19 can be fundamentally controlled till its extinction. Although the epidemic is subsiding in China, the controlling efforts should not be terminated before May.
