Finally, in 1979 the World Health Organiza- tion (WHO) announced the worldwide eradication of smallpox. The \ufb01rst vaccine against typhoid fever was developed in 1886, the \ufb01rst vaccine against cholera in 1896 and the \ufb01rst vaccine against the plague in 1897. The \ufb01rst vaccines against Bordetella pertussis followed in 1926 and the Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vac- cine against tuberculosis in 1927. In the years after 1970 vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neis- seria meningitidis, Haemophilus in\ufb02uenzae type B, an- thrax and cholera were developed. A vaccine against borreliosis was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998, but it was withdrawn from the market within less than 2 years due to more than 1000 reports of side effects [3]. The develop- ment of new vaccines has the potential to reduce not only infectious disease morbidity and mortality, but also the use of antibiotics and, consequently, the de- velopment of antimicrobial resistance. Recently, a re- combinant vaccine against two of the most common serotypes K1 and K2 of the hazardous bacterium Kleb- siella pneumoniae has been successfully utilized to protect mice against fatal infections. Klebsiella are common pathogens of nosocomial urinary and res- piratory tract infections, and particularly antibiotic- resistant types, such as carbapenemase-bearing or ex- tended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive Kleb- siella strains are characterized by complex and some- times challenging therapeutic approaches [4]. Besides antimicrobial resistance, vaccines also have the po- tential to reduce morbidity and mortality in acute global healthcare crises and to reduce the transmis- sion of infectious diseases in our globalized world. This is especially relevant regarding the ongoing pan- demic of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus is a single- stranded RNA virus causing life-threatening respira- tory illnesses [5].

To end the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the world is in urgent need of an effective, safe and durable vaccine. Currently at least 8 candidate vac- cines are being tested in clinical trials and 102 candi- date vaccines are in preclinical evaluation. Most of the candidate vaccines are mRNA or DNA vaccines, live vaccines, vector virus vaccines, inactivated vaccines or viral protein subunits vaccines. First results from human trials are expected within the next few months [7]. Since SARS-CoV-2 also affects pets and other ani- mals, an animal vaccine is also urgently needed [8]. Another vaccine urgently needed is against Plas- modium falciparium. According to the World Malaria Report 2019 an estimated 228 million cases and 405,000 deaths of malaria occurred worldwide in 2018. Several promising vaccine candidates are currently under investigation. As of 18 May 2020, there are 199 registered trials involving malaria vac- cines [9]. Currently, RTS,S/AS01 is thought to be the most advanced and extensively tested candidate vaccine against P. falciparum. The subunit vaccine induces immune response against the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) [10]. Although it is currently the only vaccine showing reliable ef\ufb01cacy against P. falciparum in a phase III clinical trial, its protective properties are only partial and decline over time [10, 11]. Despite these limitations, it is thought to exhibit public health bene\ufb01ts, especially in children in areas with high transmission and disease activity rates [12]. Unfortunately, funding volume levels for vaccine research and development decreased from US $ 181 million in 2017 to US $ 156 million in 2018, which may have dramatic effects on the development of malaria vaccine research in the future [13]. Not only have new vaccines been discovered in recent decades, numerous vaccines have also been signi\ufb01cantly improved in terms of tolerability, safety and ef\ufb01cacy. One example is the vaccination against pertussis, which was discovered around 1930. At the time, the inactivated bacteria B. pertussis was ad- ministered for vaccination purposes; however, the inactivated whole cell vaccine frequently produced side effects in the form of redness and swelling at the injection site accompanied by fever and agitation. In the 1980s the whole cell vaccine was replaced by the acellular pertussis vaccine, which had fewer side effects. Currently, the inactivated pertussis toxin is used as an antigen in the production of the acellular vaccine, either alone or in combination with other cell components [14]. The central element in the develop- ment of highly selective vaccines is the identi\ufb01cation of a speci\ufb01c and potent antigen structure that induces a long-lasting immunity preventing infection. By in- ducing a highly selective immune response, cross- reactions and side effects can be reduced.

Simultaneously, immunostimula- tory peptides further enhance the immune response [15]. Vector-based vaccines belong to a category of a new subtype of vaccines in which genes from viruses or bacteria which code for structures that trigger a neu- tralizing immune response are introduced into ap- athogenic carrier viruses (e.g. measles or yellow fever viruses). One example of a carrier virus is the measles strain Schwarz. The carrier virus itself acts as an ad- juvant-like initiator. Consequently, no conventional adjuvant is required. The structural genes introduced multiply with and within the carrier virus in the vac- cinated person, thus inducing a neutralizing immune response. Since these gene segments can be specif- ically selected and inserted, immunogenicity and side effects can be predicted and assessed relatively well [16, 17]; however, one concern that has been discussed is the possibility of a reduced immune re- sponse in subjects with pre-existing immunity due to previous measles vaccinations or measles disease in the past [18]. The fear is that existing and persistent antibody titres against the measles virus could prevent the replication of the carrier virus; however, this only seems to play a minor role in humans since adequate immune responses were detected after vaccination with a measles virus into which a chikungunya anti- gen had been introduced even in individuals with high pre-existing measles titres [19]. Therefore, viral vectors make the development of various antibacte- rial vaccines, e.g. against tuberculosis, seem feasible in the future. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Emil von Behring, Paul Ehrlich and Shibasaburo Kitasato man- aged to develop hyperimmune sera, which functioned as antitoxins against diphtheria and tetanus toxins, thus establishing a treatment option known as serum therapy [20]. Both von Behring and Ehrlich were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their research, von Behring in 1901 for his work on serum therapy and Ehrlich in 1908 for his work on immunity (Table 1). During the same period other approaches to the prophylaxis and treatment of in- fectious diseases were also explored. Later, in the 1970s hyperimmune sera largely came to be replaced by monoclonal antibodies (mAb). From the 1980s onwards, the acquired immune de\ufb01ciency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic prompted the search for immune modulators that may in\ufb02uence and modulate speci\ufb01c immune functions, the aim being, of course, to bring about an improvement in immune functionality [21]. Since then, numerous new modulators, antibiotics, antivirals, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines have been developed for the treatment and prophylaxis of infectious diseases.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9999629259, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": 0.4729921222}, {"pdf_name": "627f97852688b71135c308c1.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 2, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/627f97852688b71135c308c1.pdf_2_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.0, 842.0], "bounding_box": [125.0, 1816.0, 1227.0, 1841.0], "classes": ["Equation label", "Equation", "Page Header", "Body Text", "Figure", "Other", "Page Footer", "Reference text", "Figure Caption", "Table", "Table Note", "Table Caption", "Abstract", "Section Header"], "scores": [-2.315230608, -2.6370770931, -2.6628940105, -2.9467961788, -3.4689688683, -3.5733511448, -3.7605905533, -4.0530452728, -4.2645602226, -4.3044600487, -5.2384309769, -5.5543403625, -5.6187925339, -5.7909522057], "content": "K Immunotherapy and vaccination against infectious diseases 715", "postprocess_cls": "Page Footer", "postprocess_score": 0.9994105101, "detect_cls": "Equation label", "detect_score": -2.315230608}, {"pdf_name": "627f97852688b71135c308c1.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 3, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/627f97852688b71135c308c1.pdf_3_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.0, 842.0], "bounding_box": [0.0, 103.0, 1228.0, 155.0], "classes": ["Page Header", "Page Footer", "Equation label", "Other", "Table", "Reference text", "Body Text", "Figure Caption", "Table Note", "Table Caption", "Section Header", "Equation", "Figure", "Abstract"], "scores": [-0.864846468, -4.4458060265, -4.8821563721, -6.1440958977, -6.3073282242, -6.7144312859, -6.9417710304, -7.5650773048, -8.2508115768, -8.4090061188, -9.0141839981, -9.0200595856, -9.1266384125, -9.9027729034], "content": "review article", "postprocess_cls": "Page Header", "postprocess_score": 0.9998438358, "detect_cls": "Page Header", "detect_score": -0.864846468}, {"pdf_name": "627f97852688b71135c308c1.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 3, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/627f97852688b71135c308c1.pdf_3_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.0, 842.0], "bounding_box": [128.0, 227.0, 1229.0, 1758.0], "classes": ["Table", "Reference text", "Figure", "Page Footer", "Body Text", "Equation", "Table Note", "Equation label", "Table Caption", "Other", "Page Header", "Abstract", "Section Header", "Figure Caption"], "scores": [-1.8697639704, -3.616058588, -5.4406642914, -8.3829135895, -9.6674280167, -10.355009079, -10.7503824234, -10.8871936798, -10.9850234985, -11.4134321213, -11.5658845901, -11.5847377777, -13.9711236954, -14.4902124405], "content": "winners was 58 years, while the youngest awardee was 32 and Table 1 Overview of Nobel laureates and their scientific con- the oldest 87 at the time of the award ceremony.

Monoclonal antibodies can be produced from phage banks, B cell cultures, B cells immortalized by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or by cloning sin- gle antigen-speci\ufb01c B cells [23]. Binding capacity and opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) are indicators of functional capacity and as such must be tested using a range of different test systems. If the putative antibodies show suf\ufb01cient OPK, they can be tested in preclinical and clinical studies in animal mod- els or humans to further evaluate their therapeutic potential. The human monoclonal antibody 514G3, which is speci\ufb01cally directed against the cell wall protein S. au- reus-speci\ufb01c staphylococcal protein A (SpA), has al- ready been tested in both phase I and phase II stud- ies. After initial determination of the maximum toler- ated dose, the effect of the antibody in terms of safety and tolerance was investigated in patients suffering from S. aureus bacteremia, either methicillin-resistant or methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MRSA or MSSA). For this purpose, a regimen consisting of antibody treatment in addition to standard antibiotic therapy was compared to standard antibiotic-only treatment (NCT02357966, https://clinicaltrials.gov). The results of the study are expected imminently. A high level of ef\ufb01cacy has already been shown in animal mod- els. A survival rate of 60% was observed in exper- imental animals receiving the antibody prophylacti- cally, compared to the control group in which no an- imal survived [24]. In another animal model, it was shown that monoclonal antibodies may also be use- ful in eradicating the colonization of the nasopharynx with MRSA [25]. There is also evidence that mon- oclonal antibodies are effective in bio\ufb01lm-associated infections caused by S. aureus [23]. Another story of success in the quest for therapeu- tics and prophylactics to be used against antibiotic- resistant bacteria is constituted by the development of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, and the ongo- ing development of vaccines, against the bacterium C. dif\ufb01cile. Initially, whey from C. dif\ufb01cile-infected cows used in the treatment of C. dif\ufb01cile-associated diarrhea (CDI) in humans showed both ef\ufb01cacy with respect to recurrences of infection and good tolera- bility [26].

The monoclonal antibody bezlotoxumab directed against toxin B in CDI is both ef\ufb01cacious and has the ability to reduce the recurrence rate of CDI by about 10% [27]. Based on the characterization of their neutralizing epitopes, three vaccines against C. dif\ufb01cile in humans have been established in phase II and phase III studies so far. While even formalin-inactivated toxins can still exhibit toxin-speci\ufb01c effects, immunogenic subunits of toxins, some of which are additionally genetically engineered, are better tolerated. A vaccine made by Sano\ufb01 Pasteur MSD that uses the toxoids A and B as antigen targets has been tested in a phase II study in Japan [28]. In addition, a genetically modi\ufb01ed vac- cine manufactured by P\ufb01zer also using the toxoids A and B is currently being tested in a phase III study (NCT03090191, https://clinicaltrials.gov). A phase II study involving a recombinant fusion protein from toxins A and B (IC84/VLA84) manufactured by Valneva SE was recently completed (NCT01296386, https:// clinicaltrials.gov) [29]. A completely different approach to immune modu- lation is the foreign stool transplantation or fecal mi- crobiome transfer (FMT). In this procedure, stool from carefully selected and tested donors is transplanted into the intestines of patients suffering from C. dif\ufb01- cile. Although this form of bacteriotherapy is currently only being used in the context of (multiple) recurrent CDI, it has shown promising results [30]. The FMT has also been described to have positive results in the treatment of other diseases and in the eradica- tion of colonization with antibiotic-resistant bacteria [31]; however, the long-term consequences and side effects of these complex interventions in the human microbiome have not yet been suf\ufb01ciently explored. Careful donor selection and prior testing for infec- tious diseases and colonization with antibiotic-resis- tant microorganisms would seem to be particularly important. In fact, the FDA recently warned against the transfer of multidrug-resistant germs in the con- text of FMT [32]. Monoclonal antibodies, which are not directed against bacteria themselves but against individual components of the immune system, can also be ben- e\ufb01cial in bacterial infections and serve as immune modulators. A classical example is eculizumab, a re- combinant humanized antibody that binds specif- ically to the protein C5 in the complement sys- tem. This prevents its cleavage, which in turn pre- vents the formation of the membrane attack com- plex C5b-9. Food-associated infections with E. coli serotype O157:H7 are characterized by shigatoxin- induced hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which in turn is characterized by the triad of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure, accompanied by bloody diarrhea and neurological failures. In this pro- cess, shigatoxin binds complement factor H, resulting in an excessive response of alternative complement", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9999778271, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": 1.6966564655}, {"pdf_name": "627f97852688b71135c308c1.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 4, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/627f97852688b71135c308c1.pdf_4_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.0, 842.0], "bounding_box": [125.0, 1816.0, 1227.0, 1841.0], "classes": ["Equation label", "Body Text", "Page Header", "Equation", "Page Footer", "Figure", "Other", "Figure Caption", "Reference text", "Table", "Table Note", "Abstract", "Table Caption", "Section Header"], "scores": [-2.6536557674, -2.7923414707, -2.8382308483, -3.3190174103, -3.6523644924, -3.6642189026, -3.9320745468, -4.320453167, -4.5016450882, -4.7809562683, -5.420809269, -5.9046406746, -6.0612616539, -6.5081381798], "content": "K Immunotherapy and vaccination against infectious diseases 717", "postprocess_cls": "Page Footer", "postprocess_score": 0.9996249676, "detect_cls": "Equation label", "detect_score": -2.6536557674}, {"pdf_name": "627f97852688b71135c308c1.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 5, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/627f97852688b71135c308c1.pdf_5_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.0, 842.0], "bounding_box": [0.0, 103.0, 1228.0, 155.0], "classes": ["Page Header", "Page Footer", "Equation label", "Other", "Table", "Reference text", "Body Text", "Figure Caption", "Table Note", "Table Caption", "Section Header", "Equation", "Figure", "Abstract"], "scores": [-0.864846468, -4.4458060265, -4.8821563721, -6.1440958977, -6.3073282242, -6.7144312859, -6.9417710304, -7.5650773048, -8.2508115768, -8.4090061188, -9.0141839981, -9.0200595856, -9.1266384125, -9.9027729034], "content": "review article", "postprocess_cls": "Page Header", "postprocess_score": 0.9998438358, "detect_cls": "Page Header", "detect_score": -0.864846468}, {"pdf_name": "627f97852688b71135c308c1.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 5, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/627f97852688b71135c308c1.pdf_5_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.0, 842.0], "bounding_box": [128.0, 226.0, 660.0, 1763.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Equation label", "Page Footer", "Section Header", "Reference text", "Page Header", "Figure", "Other", "Abstract", "Table Note", "Figure Caption", "Equation", "Table", "Table Caption"], "scores": [1.9040851593, -19.728302002, -20.9278621674, -21.8350772858, -22.0981121063, -24.1334724426, -24.1696357727, -26.5120754242, -27.2925510406, -27.4629478455, -27.551279068, -33.755657196, -34.5507926941, -38.9021453857], "content": "activation at the level of factor C3b. This overreac- tion is down-regulated by eculizumab, which binds factor C5 and can thus reduce cerebral damage in HUS [33]. As a consequence, however, infections with encapsulated bacteria (N. meningitidis, H. in\ufb02uenzae, S. pneumoniae) might occur more frequently, which is why appropriate vaccinations against encapsulated pathogens are highly recommended before using eculizumab [34]. In 1928, penicillin was discovered by the Scotsman Alexander Fleming, and on 12 February 1941 it was used for the \ufb01rst time as an antibiotic in a police- man suffering from staphylococcal osteomyelitis [35]. Another early antibiotic, developed by Gerhard Do- magk in 1932, was sulfamidochrysoidin (Prontosil\u00ae), the \ufb01rst drug from the sulfonamide group [36]. At present, research into new antibiotics appears to be more important than ever, but also more dif\ufb01cult than ever since the challenge of antimicrobial resistance is expected to increase even further in the future. Nor- mally, clinically valuable antibiotics are characterized by a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Re- cently, with the discovery of ridinilazole, a narrow spectrum antibiotic has been developed that is com- paratively speci\ufb01cally directed against C. dif\ufb01cile. The advantage of ridinilazole is that it minimizes the col- lateral changes to the microbiome that occur dur- ing antibiotic therapy with vancomycin or metronida- zole, the current antibiotics of choice according to the guidelines. Although the mechanism of action has not yet been fully clari\ufb01ed, there is evidence that ridinila- zole not only exerts in\ufb02uence on the bacteria itself in the gut, but also has therapeutic effects on the bacte- rial toxins A and B and additionally reduces the local in\ufb02ammatory response [37, 38]. Phase III studies were initiated in 2019 (NCT03595566 and NCT03595553, https://clinicaltrials.gov) to further evaluate ridinila- zole\u2019s therapeutic value. Nanoparticles and arti\ufb01cial liposomes can also be used in the treatment of bacterial infections as they are able to bind bacterial toxins and cause them to lose their toxin-speci\ufb01c effects. In mice, the adminis- tration of toxin-binding liposomes prevented the clin- ical consequences of sepsis caused by S. aureus or S. pneumoniae within 10 h after infection. Experimen- tal animals which did not receive these liposomes died within 24\u201333 h [39]. Ever since the discovery of the human immunod- e\ufb01ciency viruses (HIV), people have been looking for effective ways to eliminate it in the body. Bi-speci\ufb01c T-cell engagers (BiTE) are arti\ufb01cial monoclonal anti- bodies, which exhibit both a binding site for antigen structures and another for speci\ufb01c surface proteins on T cells. In vitro experiments have already shown that the viral replication of HIV is suppressed by induc- ing BiTE antibody-mediated redirection of T cells to gp120-expressing cells.

No therapeutic strategy to target the replicative inactive viral reservoir is available to date, although this reservoir is the main cause of viral re- bound after the interruption of antiretroviral therapy. The reason for this is that the proviral DNA of HIV is anchored in the nucleus of host cells, meaning that replicative inactive cells are not recognized as infected cells by the host immune system [40]. A highly se- lective extraction of proviral DNA without damaging the host cell would be desirable. This goal seems to have been made feasible thanks to the clustered regu- larly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) method [41], which has recently been used to success- fully remove subgenomic HIV-1 DNA fragments from the genome of HIV-infected mice. Up to 5 weeks af- ter therapy, no virus was detectable in 5 of 13 animals, which suggests that the replicative inactive viral reser- voir had been reached [42]. A Chinese scientist caused a scienti\ufb01c riot when he claimed that he had created the \ufb01rst genetically modi\ufb01ed babies using the CRISPR method by induc- ing mutations, which ensured that the CCR5 recep- tor that serves as a major pathogenetic factor in early HIV spread, was not formed, thus protecting the new- borns from infection with HIV [43]. At the moment it is unclear what further consequences this proce- dure will have for the babies. Such interventions in the genomes of unborn humans are ethically highly questionable and require a debate on the framework conditions for the use of the new technologies. In the CRISPR method, CRISPR RNA binds speci\ufb01cally to DNA sequences and marks relevant sites in the genome, which then are cut by the CRISPR-associ- ated protein 9 (Cas9) nuclease. In this way, gene seg- ments can be speci\ufb01cally cut out or inserted at cer- tain sites. The same gene scissors can also be used to produce bacteriophages which can destroy spe- ci\ufb01c gene segments or plasmids in bacteria and thus inhibit pathogenicity factors or selectively switch off speci\ufb01c resistance mechanisms [44]. Recently, a 15- year-old girl suffering from cystic \ufb01brosis was suc- cessfully treated for disseminated resistant Mycobac- terium abscessus infection after lung transplantation by means of selectively produced bacteriophages [45]. Another promising new method is the so-called T-cell engineering in which speci\ufb01c receptors directed against non-self antigens of pathogenic microorgan- isms are inserted into the body\u2019s own T-lympho- cytes to give T cells the new ability to target a spe- ci\ufb01c protein. After in vitro modi\ufb01cation, the altered lymphocytes are returned to the patient. Currently, this method is mainly used in the \ufb01eld of oncology; however, a T-cell-based therapy against pathogenic microorganisms also seems conceivable and offers hope for curative responses in patients with drug- resistant infectious disease [46].
