Each  country  came  up  with  a  local solution  to  stop  the  spread  of  the  virus  by  increased  testing,  quarantining,  lock-down  of  various  events  and institutions or early vaccination. There is no clear way how these interventions can be compared, and it is especially challenging  to  predict how  combinations of  interventions  could  influence  the  pandemic.  Various  mathematical modelling approaches helped decision-makers to foresee the effects of their decisions. Most of these models rely on classical, deterministic compartmental \u201cSEIR\u201d models, which can be solved easily but cannot take into account spatial effects and most non-pharmaceutical interventions affect the same parameters, so there is no way to analyse their separate or joint effects. Agent-based microsimulations are harder to solve but can consider far more details. Several models were developed on these lines focusing on questions about ideal vaccination, lock-down or other specific problems, but none of these studies evaluated and compared the individual and mixed effects of a wide variety of control measures. Added-value of this study Here  we  present  PanSim,  a  framework  where  we  introduce  a  detailed  infection  event  simulation  step  and  the possibility to control specific workplaces individually (schools, hospitals, etc.), test various vaccination, testing and quarantine scenarios while considering preconditions, age, sex, residence and workplace of individuals and mutant  viruses  with  various  infectivity.  The  level  of  details  and  granularity  of  simulations  allow  our  work  to evaluate this wide range of scenarios and control measures accurately and directly compare them with one another to provide quantitative evidence to support decision-makers. Analysis of our simulations also provides emergent results on the risks children and non-vaccinated individuals face. Implications of all the available evidence The agent-based microsimulation framework allows us to evaluate the risk and possible consequences of particular interventions precisely. Due  to  the outstanding efficiency of the computations, it is possible to  apply scenario- based analysis and control design methods which require a high number of simulation runs to obtain results on a given confidence level. This will enable us to design and quantitatively assess control measures in case of new waves of COVID-19 or new pandemic outbreaks.", "postprocess_cls": "Reference text", "postprocess_score": 0.9859904051, "detect_cls": "Reference text", "detect_score": -1.7324850559}, {"pdf_name": "60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 2, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf_2_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.44, 841.68], "bounding_box": [162.0, 1742.0, 172.0, 1758.0], "classes": ["Equation label", "Figure Caption", "Body Text", "Page Header", "Reference text", "Section Header", "Page Footer", "Figure", "Table", "Table Caption", "Table Note", "Abstract", "Other", "Equation"], "scores": [-1.6064264774, -2.1841542721, -2.2368886471, -2.6465401649, -2.6786301136, -2.6907808781, -3.0288960934, -3.3748867512, -3.470236063, -3.6648626328, -3.8741276264, -4.2865438461, -4.3182387352, -4.3187522888], "content": "2", "postprocess_cls": "Page Footer", "postprocess_score": 0.987875402, "detect_cls": "Equation label", "detect_score": -1.6064264774}, {"pdf_name": "60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 3, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf_3_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.44, 841.68], "bounding_box": [115.0, 8.0, 1241.0, 59.0], "classes": ["Page Header", "Table", "Page Footer", "Figure Caption", "Table Caption", "Reference text", "Body Text", "Figure", "Equation label", "Table Note", "Other", "Section Header", "Abstract", "Equation"], "scores": [-1.6778167486, -4.1383228302, -4.6121191978, -4.919095993, -5.6390128136, -6.0184311867, -6.1612963676, -6.9392881393, -6.9422512054, -7.2055301666, -7.3005452156, -7.7543349266, -7.7860641479, -8.4628181458], "content": "medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.20.21259214 ; this version posted June 25, 2021.

Typically, control measures  are  differentially  applied  to  various  groups  (compartments)  of  the  society  and  decision-makers  often need  to  refocus  their  intervention  strategies  as  new  infection  hotspots  or  new  virus  variants  emerge8,9. Mathematical  modelling  is  now  increasingly  used  to  inform  decision-makers10,11.  In  these  models,  disease progression is often described by variants of the now classical SEIR approach where individuals move between disease-related  compartments  (such  as  susceptible,  exposed,  infected,  and  removed12).  A  key  element  is  the probability  of  person-to-person  disease  transmission  upon  adequate  contact,  which  defines  the  likelihood  of  a person\u2019s transition from the susceptible to the exposed compartment. This is often based on predefined values, but it can also be calculated from environmental data, using formulas of varying complexity13\u201315. Traditionally, the resulting models are then run with ordinary differential equations, which are deterministic and can provide crude estimates on how interventions may affect the outcome of the epidemic. Differential equations can be relatively easily fitted to pandemic data16\u201320 but have difficulty dealing with population heterogeneity and spatial context at sufficient resolution, especially as intervention strategies often change. For instance, differential equation driven analysis of vaccination strategies or other intervention policies is feasible and widely used19,20, but the number of compartments is  limited  and predominantly  organised  by (only  a  couple  of  parameters,  e.g.)  age or  serostatus. Another  strategy  is  provided  by  stochastic,  agent-based  models  (ABMs),  where  agents,  corresponding  to individuals,  move  and  transmit  the  infection  among  each  other.    ABMs  can  easily  handle  subgroups,  complex scenarios  and  also  provide  indications  regarding  the  geographic  spread  of  the  pandemics.  However,  they  are compute-intensive as they rely on repetitions of many elementary steps, and also, a large amount of external data is  required  for  their  parameterisation5,21\u201324.

This setup is analogous to controlling dynamical systems, a problem that occurs in many fields26. From this perspective, an intervention is a control measure (input) characterised by a few parameters (constraints), such as target (scope), speed, and resource requirements (costs). For instance, a lock-down measure can target a geographic region, or an age-group, or a type of business (say restaurants) or a given time of the day. A particular feature of pandemic management  is  that  a  series  of  interventions  or  scenarios  are  applied.  For  example,  vaccination  programs  or reopening plans are complex scenarios wherein simple interventions are carried out according to a given schedule in time and space. Precisely, in the presented micro-level model, 179,500 agents follow the statistical behaviour of the population of the Hungarian town of Szeged. At the heart of the model is an infection event, where virus transmission occurs with a probability depending on the proportion of infectious individuals present at a given location such as a home, classroom, or hospital ward22.  A fast-spreading virus variant \u2013 mastered on the example of B.1.1.7 that appeared in late 202027,28 \u2013 was considered to increase transmission probability by a factor of 1\u00b75 to 1\u00b7929,30. Disease progression was considered to follow a SEIRD-like model9 in which an individual can be in a susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, or deceased state (see supplement for details). Vaccination was included in the model as a reduction in individuals\u2019 probability of contracting the virus. It was reduced to 52% and 96% after 12- and 28-days post-vaccination31, respectively. Before the simulation, PanSim was provided with input data such  as  the  number,  age-,  sex-  distribution,  medical  precondition,  etc.,  of  the  agents,  the  structure  of  families assigned  to  various  geographic  locations,  size  of  classes  at  schools  etc.  (see  supplement  for  details).  At  the beginning of the simulation, PanSim randomly assigned the agents to various locations (homes, schools, working places, etc.) as well as to daily routines (e.g., home-work-shopping-home). The agents were then let to follow their routine in the microsimulation (Fig. 1A), and they passed on the infection to each other with some probability, which  depends  on  their  infection  status.  In  the  one-year-long  simulations,  starting  from  1st  October  2020, additional lock-down and curfew restrictions were  implemented on 11th November 2020, and vaccination was started on 1st January 2021 (see supplement for detailed parameter sets). The B.1.1.7 variant was introduced into the population starting 11th January, leading to the third wave of infections in the Spring of 2021.", "postprocess_cls": "Abstract", "postprocess_score": 0.877230525, "detect_cls": "Abstract", "detect_score": -6.392742157}, {"pdf_name": "60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 4, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf_4_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.44, 841.68], "bounding_box": [162.0, 950.0, 246.0, 969.0], "classes": ["Section Header", "Page Footer", "Page Header", "Other", "Equation label", "Body Text", "Equation", "Figure", "Reference text", "Table", "Table Caption", "Figure Caption", "Table Note", "Abstract"], "scores": [-5.161711216, -8.0838975906, -8.3349924088, -8.4885396957, -10.0080394745, -10.2076206207, -10.6351337433, -10.7243404388, -11.3650255203, -11.4253129959, -13.6277942657, -14.3415880203, -14.7310228348, -16.2110919952], "content": "Results", "postprocess_cls": "Section Header", "postprocess_score": 0.9998934269, "detect_cls": "Section Header", "detect_score": -5.161711216}, {"pdf_name": "60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 4, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf_4_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.44, 841.68], "bounding_box": [161.0, 1012.0, 1197.0, 1485.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Abstract", "Page Footer", "Figure Caption", "Table Note", "Section Header", "Table Caption", "Figure", "Reference text", "Page Header", "Equation label", "Other", "Table", "Equation"], "scores": [-5.7175474167, -8.5040988922, -12.7263736725, -13.1427555084, -14.102478981, -15.2939729691, -16.05950737, -16.2025279999, -16.2907466888, -16.947719574, -17.8443584442, -18.0516529083, -19.0646076202, -24.9824085236], "content": "Simulation outputs give geographic information about the number of simulated people at each location (Fig. 1A) and statistics on infection events at these locations (Fig. 1B). It is noticeable that restrictions decrease the number of infections generally, but the significant effects concentrate on institute types that are locked down during these restrictions  (Fig.  1B).  Closing  particular  types  of  locations  is  just  one  of  many  policies  applied  to  control  the pandemic.  The  modelling  framework  is  flexible  since  interaction  strategies  (quarantine  policies,  closures  of specific  locations,  testing  intensities,  and  reopening  timings)  can  be  implemented  by  simply  changing  input parameters rather than reprogramming the system. This makes it possible to calculate \u201eintervention landscapes\u201d in which these interventions and other key parameters (infectivity of a novel strain, vaccination intensities, and prioritisation order) are varied in a grid-like fashion, and the outcome of a given scenario is characterised by a colour code (Fig. 1C). A \u201cseverity function\u201d was calculated for the measure of the seriousness of the pandemia by adding the total number of deaths to a scaled function of the total number of hospital beds occupied above a critical limit for the whole investigated period. This analysis shows that stronger interventions (such as high vaccination rates, stringent restrictive measures), as expected, tend to improve outcomes while other factors, for instance, the infectivity of the virus variants or too early reopening, can markedly deteriorate the outcome (Fig. 1C). From these strategies, we will now concentrate on a few key control parameters of the pandemic that plague decision-makers in many countries.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9998931885, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -5.7175474167}, {"pdf_name": "60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 4, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf_4_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.44, 841.68], "bounding_box": [161.0, 1742.0, 172.0, 1757.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Figure Caption", "Figure", "Page Footer", "Equation label", "Reference text", "Table", "Page Header", "Table Note", "Section Header", "Other", "Table Caption", "Abstract", "Equation"], "scores": [-2.6679964066, -3.0892086029, -3.1567332745, -3.3033158779, -3.9477777481, -4.0775637627, -4.9504218102, -5.0558805466, -5.5945558548, -5.706600666, -5.9413061142, -6.1413493156, -6.2394471169, -6.8375873566], "content": "4", "postprocess_cls": "Page Footer", "postprocess_score": 0.997074008, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -2.6679964066}, {"pdf_name": "60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 5, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf_5_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.44, 841.68], "bounding_box": [115.0, 8.0, 1241.0, 59.0], "classes": ["Page Header", "Table", "Page Footer", "Figure Caption", "Table Caption", "Reference text", "Body Text", "Figure", "Equation label", "Table Note", "Other", "Section Header", "Abstract", "Equation"], "scores": [-1.6778167486, -4.1383228302, -4.6121191978, -4.919095993, -5.6390128136, -6.0184311867, -6.1612963676, -6.9392881393, -6.9422512054, -7.2055301666, -7.3005452156, -7.7543349266, -7.7860641479, -8.4628181458], "content": "medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.20.21259214 ; this version posted June 25, 2021.

If only the diagnosed infected patients are quarantined (Q1), and there is no contact tracing for quarantining, then the autumn wave is much larger, and most of the population get through the disease to reach herd immunity before the fast-spreading virus variant appears (Fig. 2A). With better tracking, resulting in quarantining households (Q2) as well as the classmates or a portion of workmates (Q3), the autumn wave is smaller, leaving more people susceptible for the more harmful variant in the spring wave (Fig. 2A). The severity of the pandemic is still much higher with a weaker quarantine policy because the hospital burden is exceptionally high for an extended period during the autumn wave (Fig. 1C, Fig. 2A). The simulator suggests that  the  eventual  total  number  of  deaths  is  higher  with  better  quarantining  policies,  partly  because  a  more transmissible and harmful variant appeared later (Fig. 2B).

Another  approach  is  to  select  groups  according  to  their  essentiality  and  occupational  risk,  such  as  healthcare professionals, nursing home workers, teaching personnel, etc. Both ordering methods could have their benefits, and various countries follow either one of these or a mixed prioritisation rule. In earlier plots, we assumed a mixed order used in Hungary. Still, we have also analysed the differences caused by using the two extreme strategies (see supplement  for  details  of  different  vaccination  orders).  The  occupational  risk  method  is  better  in  controlling infection  numbers  and  helps  to  maintain  key  infrastructure  (e.g.  essential  workers),  but  the  number  of  the hospitalised and deceased people is lower in the case of vulnerability-based prioritisation (Fig 3 A-C). The reason for this difference is apparently that the elderly and people with chronic conditions who otherwise make up the majority of hospitalised and deceased patients are vaccinated first, and so they avoid infection. Early vaccination of highly vulnerable groups can in itself reduce the hospital burden even at higher infection rates in the spring wave (Fig 3B). Nevertheless, the key strategy to control the pandemic is to increase the vaccination intensity (Fig. 3D), which could have a far larger effect than varying the vaccination order (compare Fig. 3B \u2013 before reopening and Fig. 3D).", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9999693632, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -2.1576855183}, {"pdf_name": "60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 7, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf_7_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.44, 841.68], "bounding_box": [162.0, 617.0, 765.0, 637.0], "classes": ["Section Header", "Page Header", "Figure", "Body Text", "Equation", "Equation label", "Other", "Figure Caption", "Page Footer", "Reference text", "Table", "Abstract", "Table Caption", "Table Note"], "scores": [-3.3565759659, -6.2527618408, -7.3447899818, -7.9302983284, -8.393872261, -9.117562294, -9.6280965805, -12.1537733078, -12.6161079407, -13.6621599197, -15.1985912323, -16.5375652313, -17.0355701447, -17.6149997711], "content": "Too early reopening after lock-downs can lengthen pandemics", "postprocess_cls": "Section Header", "postprocess_score": 0.9098104835, "detect_cls": "Section Header", "detect_score": -3.3565759659}, {"pdf_name": "60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 7, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/60d6462af7f6fdf73f7c8bd1.pdf_7_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.44, 841.68], "bounding_box": [161.0, 674.0, 1195.0, 784.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Abstract", "Table Note", "Figure Caption", "Page Footer", "Other", "Reference text", "Figure", "Section Header", "Equation label", "Table Caption", "Page Header", "Table", "Equation"], "scores": [-4.5492224693, -7.2855453491, -8.3297567368, -8.5680122375, -10.1061668396, -10.2403593063, -11.7964353561, -13.2770595551, -13.9788618088, -14.0757961273, -14.1478624344, -14.5249862671, -16.1454811096, -19.9750366211], "content": "Curfew in evening hours and lock-down of social event sites, restaurants, and pubs is a crucial strategy to control pandemics by decreasing the number of interactions between individuals.
