The Egyptian rousette bat (ERB) is a known reservoir host for Marburg virus (MARV). Following infection of ERBs with MARV, virus-specific IgG antibodies are induced but rapidly wane and by 3 months post-infection the bats are seronegative. To determine whether reinfection of ERBs plays a role in MARV maintenance, we challenge groups of ERBs that were \u201cnaturally\u201d or experimentally infected with MARV 17\u201324 months prior. No bats in either group exhibit evidence of MARV replication or shedding and all bats develop virus-specific secondary immune responses.

Although much insight on the natural history of virus infection in bats has been gained from experimental infections3, 6\u201311 and mathematical modeling12\u201315, with the exception of Nipah and rabies viruses16, 17, relatively little is known about the long-term dynamics of the host immune response following primary virus infection. Of particular interest is whether or not long-term protective immunity is established following virus infection. This gap in knowledge can be attributed to: 1) the difficulties associated with obtaining serial biological samples from individual bats comprising large colonial, interconnected populations and 2) the uncertainty of whether short-term experimental models of virus infection in bats recapitu- late natural bat-virus infection dynamics. Nonetheless, obtaining empirical data on the long-term dynamics of the bat immune response following virus infection is critical to understanding how bat-borne viruses are maintained in nature and identifying factors leading to virus spillover into humans. The marburgviruses (family Filoviridae, genus Marburgvirus, Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV)) cause outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease in sub-Saharan Africa characterized by human-to-human transmission and high case fatality ratios18. The cave-roosting Egyptian rousette bat (ERB; Rousettus aegyptia- cus) has been identified as a natural reservoir host for the marburgviruses and a source of virus emergence in humans2, 19, 20. A longitudinal ecological study of marburgvirus infection in large ERB populations at Python Cave and Kitaka Mine, Uganda revealed an age-associated cyclical pattern of virus infection in which pups (0.0% PCR prevalence) are seemingly protected from virus infection through maternal antibodies until becoming inde- pendent, young juveniles at roughly 3 months of age (2.7% PCR prevalence, 4.1% seroprevalence)19. Acute virus infection levels increase in the juvenile population, peaking at 6 months of age (12.4% PCR prevalence, 14.8% seroprevalence), coincidental with the timing of the biannual birthing seasons. Juveniles enter the adult popu- lation at 7\u20138 months of age; a population that experiences year-round, consistent levels of virus infection (2.4% PCR prevalence, 21.5% seroprevalence).

This discrepancy is likely due to waning marburgvirus antibody levels that may or may not be indicative of diminished protective immunity14. Serological data gathered from experimental studies of MARV infection in captive ERBs8\u201311 corroborate marburgvirus seroprevalence predictions generated by the SEIR model of marburgvirus transmission in ERBs14. Shortly after experimental inoculation of ERBs with MARV, the virus can be detected in the blood from 1-16 days post infection (DPI; 100% of bats for a mean duration of 6.0 d)11, the oral mucosa from 5\u201319 DPI (91.7% of bats for a mean duration of 4.6 d)11, multiple tissues from 2\u201312 DPI8\u201310 and the spleen up to 28 DPI (66.7% of bats at this time point)8. MARV IgG antibodies peak by 28 DPI and then rapidly decline8\u201311, falling below the threshold of seropositivity by 3 months post infection (MPI)11. Short-term protective immunity against viral replication and shedding has been demonstrated in seropositive ERBs challenged with homologous virus 48 days following experimental inoculation with a moderately high dose of MARV9. However, whether natural MARV infection generates long-term immunity sufficient to fully protect seronegative ERBs from viral reinfection, replication and shedding remains unclear. We previously demonstrated horizontal MARV transmission between experimentally infected and na\u00efve con- tact ERBs11. In this study, we assess whether MARV infection confers long-term protective immunity against reinfection, replication and shedding by challenging groups of ERBs that had been experimentally or \u201cnaturally\u201d infected 17\u201324 months prior during the previous transmission study with homologous virus. Following chal- lenge, evidence of MARV replication in the blood and viral shedding from the oral mucosa is monitored for 14 days, MARV IgG antibody responses are monitored for 21 days and tissues obtained at necropsy at 21 days are tested for the presence of MARV RNA. Herein, we show that no bats in either group exhibit evidence of MARV replication or shedding. Further, all bats develop virus-specific secondary immune responses, demonstrating that infection of ERBs with MARV induces long-term, and likely lifelong, protective immunity against reinfection.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9989548922, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -2.4149954319}, {"pdf_name": "616e7fcd67467f7269d41897.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 2, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e7fcd67467f7269d41897.pdf_2_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.276, 782.362], "bounding_box": [382.0, 1241.0, 1360.0, 1486.0], "classes": ["Figure Caption", "Body Text", "Section Header", "Abstract", "Page Footer", "Reference text", "Figure", "Table Note", "Other", "Table Caption", "Equation label", "Page Header", "Table", "Equation"], "scores": [-7.3081130981, -8.6237440109, -10.3919820786, -14.3941392899, -16.591173172, -19.0011615753, -19.6401901245, -20.1101264954, -20.2586917877, -20.5048217773, -21.8906650543, -22.7150535583, -27.1765041351, -27.3621616364], "content": "Results Bat groups and expectations.

Prior to the initiation of this study, ERBs that were experimentally inoculated with MARV 24 months previously and those that were \u201cnaturally\u201d infected through contact with infectious ERBs approximately 17\u201318 months previously were MARV seronegative11. Following subcutaneous challenge with a moderately high dose of MARV, virus was not detected in daily blood or oral swab specimens taken through 14 DPC and axillary lymph node, gonad, liver, salivary gland or spleen tissue taken at 21 DPC. A robust MARV IgG antibody response was observed at 7 DPC. The absence of MARV replication in the blood and spleen and virus shedding from the oral mucosa coupled with a rapidly attained, robust MARV IgG antibody response upon virus re-exposure is characteristic of a fully protective, sec- ondary immune response. Our data demonstrate that diminished MARV IgG antibody levels following primary infection are not associ- ated with the loss of long-term protective immunity against virus reinfection, replication and shedding. This find- ing is in contrast to an experimental study on repeated rabies virus infection of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), which found that primary infection followed by a transient virus-specific neutralizing antibody response was not able to protect all bats from reinfection and mortality upon challenge 6 months later16. Evidence for Nipah virus recrudescence was reported in an adult female large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus) who was seropositive at study entry, seronegative 1 month later, shed infectious virus in the urine ~10 months later and then returned to being seropositive within 2 weeks17. Other studies have also observed rapidly waning virus-specific IgG or neutralizing antibodies following experimental infection of bats with Nipah6, 7, Hendra6 and Japanese encephalitis viruses21. Serological assays designed to detect virus-specific IgG or neutralizing antibodies in bats, particularly those with conservatively high seropositivity thresholds, likely underestimate the number of past infections as they are only able to detect those that have been infected recently (<3 months) or exposed to the virus more than once. This likely explains the discrepancy between observed and predicted seroprevalence in the SEIR model of marburg- virus transmission in ERBs14 and indicates that mathematical models of filovirus-natural host dynamics should continue to be parameterized using virus PCR prevalence data rather than seroprevalence data.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.975892961, "detect_cls": "Page Footer", "detect_score": -4.0766620636}, {"pdf_name": "616e7fcd67467f7269d41897.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 3, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e7fcd67467f7269d41897.pdf_3_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.276, 782.362], "bounding_box": [99.0, 1846.0, 1361.0, 1880.0], "classes": ["Other", "Page Footer", "Table", "Figure", "Table Note", "Equation label", "Page Header", "Table Caption", "Equation", "Section Header", "Reference text", "Abstract", "Body Text", "Figure Caption"], "scores": [-5.7320580482, -5.7550177574, -8.6356744766, -9.5782079697, -9.5940475464, -10.3732204437, -11.3709144592, -11.4675941467, -11.5121068954, -12.3588619232, -12.3770923615, -12.5667743683, -13.456328392, -14.9693384171], "content": "3", "postprocess_cls": "Page Footer", "postprocess_score": 0.9996905327, "detect_cls": "Other", "detect_score": -5.7320580482}, {"pdf_name": "616e7fcd67467f7269d41897.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 4, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e7fcd67467f7269d41897.pdf_4_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.276, 782.362], "bounding_box": [0.0, 0.0, 1460.0, 71.0], "classes": ["Page Header", "Other", "Page Footer", "Equation label", "Body Text", "Table", "Reference text", "Table Note", "Figure", "Figure Caption", "Abstract", "Table Caption", "Equation", "Section Header"], "scores": [-1.1870296001, -2.4023902416, -3.6052532196, -3.8104798794, -4.3335881233, -4.5162930489, -4.5442643166, -4.8032751083, -5.73042202, -5.8701133728, -6.0710325241, -6.0954174995, -6.3539614677, -6.459956646], "content": "", "postprocess_cls": "Page Header", "postprocess_score": 0.9989513159, "detect_cls": "Page Header", "detect_score": -1.1870296001}, {"pdf_name": "616e7fcd67467f7269d41897.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 4, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e7fcd67467f7269d41897.pdf_4_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.276, 782.362], "bounding_box": [379.0, 122.0, 1362.0, 1518.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Figure", "Reference text", "Page Footer", "Page Header", "Abstract", "Equation label", "Section Header", "Figure Caption", "Table", "Other", "Equation", "Table Note", "Table Caption"], "scores": [-7.0362420082, -10.9744644165, -16.6976642609, -19.318403244, -19.9919586182, -22.6109142303, -23.3648796082, -24.2037715912, -24.5761928558, -24.6219215393, -25.1677036285, -25.9674854279, -27.7319526672, -33.429359436], "content": "A previous study showed short-term protective immunity against MARV reinfection in seropositive ERBs challenged with homologous virus 48 days following experimental infection9. Here, we demonstrate long-term protective immunity against MARV reinfection in seronegative ERBs that were infected with homologous virus 17\u201324 months earlier. Annual survival probabilities estimated from demographic studies of frugivorous bats range from 0.43 (juvenile females) to 0.53 (juvenile males) for the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto)22, 0.43 (juve- niles) to 0.83 (adults) for the straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum)23 and 0.47 (males) to 0.58 (females) for the common fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis)24. An exponential life table created from ~16,000 captures of ~9,000 A. jamaicensis estimated the average lifespan of this bat in the wild to be 1.6 years24. Based on these estimates, it is likely that the average lifespan of wild ERBs does not exceed 24 months and that primary MARV infection pro- vides lifelong protective immunity against reinfection. The results of this study indicate that reinfection of bats with MARV as a consequence of diminished pro- tective immunity does not significantly contribute to virus maintenance in natural ERB populations. A combi- nation of other factors, such as seasonal variation in host and environmental factors, large population sizes and metapopulation dynamics, likely drive MARV maintenance and prevent virus extinction. Seasonal variations in precipitation and temperature, as well as host aggregation, births, deaths and immunity, have been shown to play a major role in the persistence of many wildlife diseases25, including bat-borne viruses. Reduced mortality of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) during winter hibernation has been associated with rabies virus maintenance13 and the birthing and lactation stages of the seasonal reproductive cycle in little red flying foxes (Pteropus scapulatus) have been linked to a higher risk of Hendra virus infection26. Marburgvirus prevalence data collected during the longitudinal ecological investigation of ERB colonies at Python Cave and Kitaka Mine, Uganda revealed that distinct pulses of virus infection in newly susceptible six-month old ERBs temporally coincided the biannual birthing season19, which occurs just before the peak of the rainy season27. The SEIR model of marburgvirus infection14 found that the virus was only able to persist when biannual breeding was incorporated into the model. Mathematical modeling of infectious agent-host dynamics indicate that pathogen persistence increases gradually with population size28 and measles virus, perhaps the most comprehensively modeled virus-host system, was not predicted to persist in isolated populations of less than 250,000 individuals29, 30. ERB colonies in tropical Africa where marburgviruses are found are large, often numbering over 100,000 individuals19, while ERB colonies in the Palearctic Region where marburgviruses have never been reported are considerably smaller, comprising no more than 1,500 individuals31. Accordingly, modeling predicted that marburgviruses were only able to persist in ERB populations > 20,000 individuals14. Extinction of infectious diseases in mobile populations is typically local as the agent can be reintroduced from spatially separated populations through the dispersal of infectious animals. Metapopulation dynamics have been shown to play a role in the persistence of measles virus in demo- graphically heterogeneous human populations32, Hendra virus in flying foxes (Pteropus spp.) in Australia15 and Nipah virus in large flying foxes (P. vampyrus) and variable flying foxes (Pteropus hypomelanus) in Malaysia33. ERBs are patchily distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with the limit of their geographic range extending north into southern Turkey and east into Pakistan34. Mark-recapture studies have documented movement pat- terns of ERBs ranging from local migration between roosts 35 km35 to 50 km2, 19 apart to long-distance migration up to 500 km35. Infectious marburgvirus has been exchanged through the sub-Saharan metapopulation network, as evidenced through the detection of homologous marburgvirus sequences from bats and humans throughout sub-Saharan Africa19, 20. Although valuable information on the long-term dynamics of the ERB immune response to MARV was obtained from this study, the data should be interpreted in light of its limitations. This study used a small number of 2-year old, laboratory-bred bats that were contained in a controlled environment throughout the study. If more bats had been included in this study, we may have observed individual variations in response to MARV challenge. Unlike their wild counterparts, these experimental bats were not subjected to stressors including pregnancy, lactation, poor nutrition, predation, high ectoparasite burdens and infection with other pathogens. It is possible that exposure to natural stressors such as these could compromise the host immune system, resulting in increased susceptibility to reinfection with marburgviruses in nature. Lactation has been significantly correlated with coro- navirus detection in Myotis spp. and Pipistrellus spp.36, pregnancy and lactation were significant risk factors for Hendra virus neutralizing antibodies in longitudinally-sampled spectacled flying foxes (Pteropus conspicillatus)37 and little red flying foxes (P. scapulatus)26, and nutritional stress was a significant risk factor for detectable Hendra virus neutralizing antibodies in longitudinally-sampled P. scapulatus26. In conclusion, this study provides empirical evidence that \u201cnatural\u201d infection of ERBs with MARV confers long-term protective immunity against virus reinfection, replication and shedding. This indicates that MARV maintenance in the ERB population is likely driven by other factors such as influxes of susceptible juveniles pro- vided by the twice-yearly birth pulse, large population sizes and metapopulation dynamics. Further research is needed to determine the specific mechanisms involved in MARV clearance and protective immunity.", "postprocess_cls": "Figure", "postprocess_score": 0.6689867973, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -7.0362420082}, {"pdf_name": "616e7fcd67467f7269d41897.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 4, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e7fcd67467f7269d41897.pdf_4_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.276, 782.362], "bounding_box": [382.0, 1543.0, 1361.0, 1764.0], "classes": ["Figure Caption", "Section Header", "Table Caption", "Abstract", "Page Header", "Page Footer", "Reference text", "Table Note", "Body Text", "Other", "Figure", "Table", "Equation label", "Equation"], "scores": [2.8826003075, -8.9678859711, -10.0841693878, -11.6111860275, -13.8466205597, -14.6433982849, -14.7100429535, -15.594827652, -15.646490097, -16.1807117462, -17.6388607025, -20.0314445496, -20.1032066345, -21.1300868988], "content": "Methods Virus.

The number of bats used in this study was based on their previous MARV infection status (experimentally infected, \u201cnaturally infected or na\u00efve negative control), as well as the amount of BSL-4 laboratory space required and the number of personnel needed to care for the bats over 24 months. The bat groups were sex-matched and no other methods of randomization were used throughout the study.
