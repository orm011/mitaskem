identified in Wuhan, China and, later on, detected in other parts of China. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. Methods: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. COVID-19 daily data of the mainland of China excluding Hubei province, including the cumulative confirmed cases, the cumulative deaths, newly confirmed cases and the cumulative recovered cases between 20 January and 3 March 2020, were archived from the National Health Commission of China (NHCC). We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number (Rc), as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio-Re(t), of the disease transmission in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province. Results: The estimation outcomes indicate that Rc is 3.36 (95% CI: 3.20\u20133.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since 31 January 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in the mainland of China are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to a prolonged disease transmission period and more people would be infected, and may even cause a second wave of epidemic or outbreaks. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we prove that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020. Conclusions: To ensure the pandemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, keeping social distance, etc. People should (Continued on next page)", "postprocess_cls": "Table Note", "postprocess_score": 0.557143867, "detect_cls": "Page Footer", "detect_score": -5.2358832359}, {"pdf_name": "616fd5fb67467f7269d9e04c.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 1, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616fd5fb67467f7269d9e04c.pdf_1_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.0, 791.0], "bounding_box": [139.0, 1446.0, 1300.0, 1781.0], "classes": ["Table", "Page Footer", "Table Caption", "Figure Caption", "Table Note", "Abstract", "Other", "Reference text", "Figure", "Section Header", "Body Text", "Equation label", "Equation", "Page Header"], "scores": [-5.0201134682, -5.2749171257, -5.6518387794, -6.6301913261, -6.9416003227, -7.182308197, -8.5476388931, -8.9113340378, -10.4167251587, -10.7645292282, -11.3992328644, -12.3834590912, -13.4740533829, -13.4936609268], "content": "*Correspondence: guojingyang@hotmail.com \u2020Hui Wan, Jing-An Cui and Guo-Jing Yang contributed equally to this work. 3Hainan Medical University, 571199 Haikou, China 4Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Socinstrasse 57, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland Full list of author information is available at the end of the article \u00a9 The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

They belong to the order of Nidovirales, family of Coronaviri- dae, and subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae [1]. In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (later named as COVID-19 by WHO) was identified in Wuhan, China and, later on, detected in other parts of China. By 27 February, the new virus had infected 78 824 people and killed 2788 people in China [2]. Besides China, more than 4440 people had been infected and 67 died in at least 48 countries and regions [3]. Currently, there are no vaccines or anti-viral treatments officially approved for the prevention or management of the diseases. The outbreaks are still on-going [3]. The basic reproduction number R0 is the average num- ber of secondary infections due to an infective case during the infectious period when everyone else in the population is susceptible [4]. While the basic reproduction number with control measures is defined as the control repro- duction number Rc. At the early stage of the outbreak, estimation of R0/Rc is crucial for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak, and providing precise infor- mation for designing and implementing disease outbreak responses, namely the identification of the most appro- priate, evidence-based interventions, mitigation measures and the determination of the intensity of such programs in order to achieve the maximal protection of the popu- lation with the minimal interruption of social-economic activities [5, 6]. Recently, some papers have been released as pre-prints or undergone peer-review and published to estimate R0 and the risk of outbreak. Li et al. [7] analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan and determined the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19. Based on their estimates, the mean incubation period was 5.2 days, and R0 was 2.2, which is in line with the result estimated by Riou et al. [8]. Zhao et al. [9] assessed the unreported number of COVID-19 cases in China in the first half of January with the estimation of R0 2.56. Considering the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, Zhao et al.

Li et al. [11] conducted a mathematical modeling study using five inde- pendent methods to assess R0 of COVID-19. Their results illustrated that R0 dropped from 4.38 to 3.41 right after the lockdown of Wuhan city. Over the epidemic period of the study COVID-19 had an average R0 of 3.39. Moreover, Tang et al. formulated a deterministic compartmental model. Their estimations based on likelihood and dynam- ical model analysis showed that R0 with control measures might be as high as 6.47 [6]. Most recently, Chen et al. [12] developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmis- sion network model to simulate the potential transmission from the infectious sources to human. The estimated val- ues of R0 were 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person. We noticed that the estimations of R0 in varied studies are different. As mentioned in references of [6, 13], variability in the estimation of the basic repro- duction number is a general recognized methodological issue, and standardized methods both for calculating and reporting R0 are still missing. Furthermore, the value of R0 may vary with key clinical parameters inferred from data which depend on the time period, quality, accuracy, and reliability. To better quantify the evolution of the inter- ventions, Tang et al. fitted the previously proposed model in reference [6] to the data available until 29 January 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction [14]. There are also some literatures focusing on the prediction of COVID-19 development trend. Wang et al. formulated a complex network model and analyzed the possible time node and the risk impact of resumption on secondary out- break in Wuhan and surrounding areas [15]. Roosa et al. [16] utilized several dynamic models to forecast the cumu- lative number of confirmed cases in the coming 5, 10, and 15 days in Hubei province, and the overall trajectory of the epidemic in China excluding Hubei. With the gradual alleviation of the epidemic situa- tion in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province, considering the pressure of economic operation and the needs of people\u2019s normal production and life, some places have adjusted the primary response of epidemic preven- tion and control to the secondary response [17]. In this situation, some critical questions need to be answered promptly. Does the reduction of the emergency response level mean that people can fully or partially relieve from self-production? When can people return back to normal life?", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9999825954, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": 1.9295965433}, {"pdf_name": "616fd5fb67467f7269d9e04c.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 3, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616fd5fb67467f7269d9e04c.pdf_3_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.0, 791.0], "bounding_box": [139.0, 85.0, 448.0, 103.0], "classes": ["Section Header", "Body Text", "Equation label", "Page Header", "Page Footer", "Figure Caption", "Reference text", "Figure", "Table Note", "Other", "Abstract", "Table Caption", "Equation", "Table"], "scores": [-0.7799092531, -1.3827264309, -1.4186508656, -2.9062373638, -3.0593235493, -3.1158151627, -3.1920015812, -3.617777586, -3.9547734261, -4.0966486931, -4.6541051865, -4.737473011, -5.2630996704, -5.3426771164], "content": "Wan et al.

Birth and natural death are also neglected. With the increase of the cumula- tive number of confirmed cases, the probability of contact transmission among the informed susceptible popula- tions would certainly reduce ([18\u201320], etc.). To better quantify the varied interventions and self-protection mea- sures, we assume the contact rate to be time-dependent c(t) = q1(t)c0, where c0 is the initial contact rate and q1(t) is the intervention coefficient with respect to con- tact. Here we assume that q1(t) = e\u2212\u03b4T (t), which is dependent on the total number of cumulative confirmed cases T (t) and is monotone decreasing with T (t), so as to well reflect the impact of media coverage on people\u2019s psychology and behaviors. c(t) = c0 for T = 0 and lim t\u2192\u221e c(T ) = 0. It should be mentioned that the contact function c(t) in [14] is also assumed to be time-dependent, but it is not dependent on state variables. Let the trans- mission probability be \u03b2. Thus, the incidence rate can be given by \u03b2c(t) (I + \u03beA) S N , where \u03be is the correction factor of transmission probability with asymptomatic infectious individuals. By frequent monitoring of body temperature and diag- noses in hospitals, symptomatic infectious individuals can be detected. The detection rate is assumed to be q2I(t). Infected individuals in Q class can be confirmed at the rate of \u03b7Q(t) by nucleic acid testing. Additionally, close contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation is a critical control measure. We assume that, once a case is confirmed, q3 individuals would be traced. Therefore, q3(q2I(t) + \u03b7Q(t)) individuals would be traced in a unit time, which is dependent on the number of new con- firmed cases q2I(t) + \u03b7Q(t).

Under the current rigorous integrated control and self- protection measures, the time series of T (t) depicted in Fig. 4a shows that the cumulative number of confirmed cases will continue growing slowly for some duration and tend to its predicted maximum, which is 13 155. Besides, although the number of hospitalized individuals has peaked on around 12 February 2020, but it will not shrink to zero in the near future (Fig. 4e). Obviously, once people start relieving self-isolation and protection, new infections would occur given the existence of undetected infectious individuals.

Particularly, we adopted two novel function forms which dynamically captured the real-time endemic situation. The first one is the contact rate, c(t), which was assumed to be dependent on the cumulative number of confirmed cases to better quantify the var- ied interventions and self-protection measures. The other one is the contact tracing function, which was dependent on the number of new cases. We evaluated the impact of partial lifting control mea- sures on COVID-19 transmission. Our results show that relaxing self-protection too early may lead to a prolonged transmission period and more people would be infected, and may even cause the second wave of epidemic or out- breaks. The reduction of the emergency response level does not mean that people can be relaxed thoroughly. At least until the end of March, life will not be able to return to normal. In the process of recovery of production and life, we should pay attention to take protective measures to mini- mize the contact between people, such as wearing masks, keeping social distance, and avoiding crowded places to cut the risk of infection. By calculating the effective repro- duction ratio, we assert that people\u2019s contact rate should be kept below 30% of the normal level and the lower the better. Our study outcomes are based on the assumption of no imported cases from Hubei and other regions. However, new endemic foci outside China are formed, such as Republic of Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, etc. The WHO recently upgraded the global risk of the epidemic to \u2018very high\u2019. Although the current endemic situation in China is under control, these newly formed epidemic foci could generate the risk of second outbreak wave due to imported cases via population migration cross border. With the development of the critical epidemic situation in other countries, it is very important to maintain and strengthen the quarantine of entry personnel. The impact of international mobility on the transmission of COVID- 19 will be studied in our future works.

In Wuhan, because of the sudden appearance of the disease, it took much longer time to recognize and understand the disease transmission than other regions. It requires certain time from unknown to known. Therefore, the data accuracy in Wuhan, Hubei is a major issue for parameters\u2019 calibration. In addition, the sudden large outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei exhausted all medical resources in a short time. A more targeted model considering medical resource capacity will be anticipated in the future. Our results manifest that the model yields a good visual fit to the epidemic curve except for the cumulative recov- ered cases. The number of predicted recovered cases is less than the number of actual recovered individuals in the later period of data fitting. The possible reason is that the recovery rate of hospitalized individuals was increasing with the improvement of treatment level and the increase of medical resources. In addition, due to increased contact tracing efficiency, large quantity of mild symptomatic cases were detected and hospitalised which has higher recover rate than other classified cases. A time- dependent recovery rate may be more suitable to fit the real data. Furthermore, age is a key parameter deter- mining the mortality and recover rates. It is ideal to set up age-structured agent-based or meta population-based deterministic models which can capture this important risk factor. In this work, the initial value of the suscepti- ble class S(0) was set to be the population of the mainland of China excluding Hubei province. Actually, the number of susceptible individuals is not as many as this number considering the very strict control measures implemented and the difference of behaviors between different age groups. A proper method to estimate the accurate num- ber of susceptible individuals should be studied in the future. Besides, the impact of limited medical resources is another important issue that is not incorporated in our model. The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 accounting for the potential negative effects of health sys- tems being overwhelmed on mortality will be studied in our future work.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9999979734, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": 1.5560566187}, {"pdf_name": "616fd5fb67467f7269d9e04c.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 8, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616fd5fb67467f7269d9e04c.pdf_8_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 595.0, 791.0], "bounding_box": [738.0, 509.0, 1307.0, 763.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Page Footer", "Reference text", "Figure", "Equation label", "Table Note", "Section Header", "Abstract", "Figure Caption", "Other", "Page Header", "Table", "Table Caption", "Equation"], "scores": [0.4687419832, -17.7817230225, -20.9896259308, -21.4013290405, -21.4132118225, -21.425786972, -21.635969162, -21.6617450714, -22.9999446869, -24.6596469879, -25.4435100555, -31.749874115, -32.5481491089, -33.7246780396], "content": "control intervention and self-protection measures, includ- ing travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, keeping social distance, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April.
