Typical ABMs contain three elements: agents, an environment, and rules governing each agent\u2019s behavior and its local interactions with other agents and with the environment. Decades of advance- ment in computer power has made agent-based modeling a feasible and appealing tool to study a variety of complex and dynamic systems, especially within the life sciences. As the use of ABMs in research has grown, so too has the inclusion of ABMs in life science and mathematical modeling courses as a means of exploring and predicting how individual-level behavior and interactions among individuals lead to system-level observable patterns. ABMs are now one of the many types of models students study- ing the life sciences or applied mathematics should encounter in their undergraduate education. Prior to the introduction of ABMs into biological and applied mathematics curric- ula, the clear model format of choice was the ordinary differential equation (ODE), or maybe a pair of them; occasionally, discrete difference equations and/or matrix equa- tions would also be introduced. Exponential growth and decay were ready examples, paving the way for extensions of the exponential growth process toward a carrying capacity in the form of the logistic growth process (Voit 2020). This logistic process was easily generalized to two populations, which were at \ufb01rst independent, but then allowed to interact. Depending on these interactions, the result was a pair of two popu- lations competing for the same resource or a simple predator\u2013prey model in the format of a two-variable Lotka\u2013Volterra system. Although ODEs and any other types of \u201cDiff-E-Qs\u201d are a priori dreaded by almost all but mathematicians and physicists, the concept of an ODE, if adequately explained, becomes quite intuitive. For instance, one may ease a novice into the world of ODEs by considering changes in the water level W of a lake over time (Ayalew 2019). Whereas these dynamics are dif\ufb01cult to formulate as an explicit function W (t ), newcomers readily understand that changes in the water level depend on in\ufb02uxes from tributaries, rain, and other sources on the supply side, and on ef\ufb02uxes, evaporation and water utilization on the side of reducing the amount of water. Just putting these components into an equation leads directly to a differential equation of the system (Weisstein 2011). On the left side, one \ufb01nds the change over time as dW /dt, and this change is driven, on the right-hand side, by a sum of augmenting and diminishing processes. There is hardly a limit to what can be achieved with ODEs in biology, with the very important exception of processes that have genuine spatial features. And while it is not dif\ufb01cult to ease a biology undergraduate into ordinary differential equations, the same is not necessarily true for partial differential equations (PDEs). However, spatial phenomena in biology seldom occur in homogeneous conditions. As examples, consider the formation of tumors with angiogenesis and necrosis; the local patterns of cell-to-cell signaling that governs the embryonic development; the spread of the red \ufb01re ant (Solenopsis invicta) from Mobile, AL, its alleged port of entry into the USA, all along the Gulf and East Coasts; or the population size and dynamics of the Santa Cruz island fox (Urocyon littoralis santacruzae) being driven by territory", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9999818802, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": 0.7679620981}, {"pdf_name": "616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 2, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf_2_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 439.37, 666.142], "bounding_box": [141.0, 1791.0, 260.0, 1823.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Section Header", "Other", "Page Footer", "Page Header", "Equation label", "Equation", "Figure Caption", "Figure", "Table Note", "Reference text", "Table", "Table Caption", "Abstract"], "scores": [-5.2969045639, -5.383708477, -9.02298069, -9.5192890167, -11.4823551178, -12.2905731201, -13.5921020508, -13.8819761276, -13.8861579895, -15.971953392, -16.5397701263, -18.036781311, -18.7484817505, -19.9600334167], "content": "123", "postprocess_cls": "Page Footer", "postprocess_score": 0.6333544254, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -5.2969045639}, {"pdf_name": "616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 3, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf_3_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 439.37, 666.142], "bounding_box": [146.0, 97.0, 1118.0, 134.0], "classes": ["Page Header", "Body Text", "Page Footer", "Section Header", "Figure", "Figure Caption", "Other", "Table Note", "Table", "Table Caption", "Equation", "Equation label", "Reference text", "Abstract"], "scores": [-6.2245950699, -6.5560789108, -8.1790390015, -9.0882196426, -9.4546003342, -11.2861938477, -12.0743255615, -13.5968046188, -13.7222251892, -13.8902130127, -15.6945085526, -16.5460071564, -16.6959495544, -18.9371776581], "content": "Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation in Mathematics...

Until relatively recently, the conundrum of space was often dealt with in the \ufb01nal chapter of mathematical modeling in biology. A sea change came with the development of ABMs, which are natural formats for both stochasticity and spatial phenomena. By their nature, these models are computationally expensive, which initially prevented their use in most classrooms. However, this situation has obviously changed. As the Bio2010 Report (2003) stated: \u201cComputer use is a fact of life of all modern life scientists. Exposure during the early years of their undergraduate careers will help life science students use current computer methods and learn how to exploit emerging computer technologies as they arise.\u201d Classroom use of ABMs has thus become not just logistically feasible, but also very appealing for demonstrating spatial dynamics in a wide range of biological systems (Kottonau 2011; Triulzi & Pyka 2011; Shi\ufb02et 2013; Pinder 2013). Supporting this appeal is a repertoire of software tools, such as SimBio and NetLogo (see Sect. 3), that contain prede\ufb01ned examples and require minimal computer coding skills for model analysis. Here, we present a brief synopsis and history of this modeling approach with emphasis on life science applications (Sect. 2), describe some of the software tools most frequently used in the classroom (Sect. 3), and then focus on some of its roles and limitations in the classroom (Sect. 4).", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9999735355, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": 0.9129740596}, {"pdf_name": "616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 3, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf_3_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 439.37, 666.142], "bounding_box": [147.0, 887.0, 787.0, 916.0], "classes": ["Section Header", "Page Footer", "Figure Caption", "Page Header", "Other", "Body Text", "Reference text", "Table Caption", "Figure", "Table Note", "Equation", "Abstract", "Equation label", "Table"], "scores": [-0.9821858406, -7.7481040955, -9.7040500641, -9.7684049606, -10.0041284561, -10.1708955765, -10.7693405151, -10.9883708954, -12.8289022446, -12.9790382385, -13.4644603729, -13.9628658295, -14.5101718903, -14.9744672775], "content": "2 Background, Rationale, and Pitfalls of ABMs", "postprocess_cls": "Section Header", "postprocess_score": 0.9997293353, "detect_cls": "Section Header", "detect_score": -0.9821858406}, {"pdf_name": "616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 3, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf_3_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 439.37, 666.142], "bounding_box": [146.0, 959.0, 1118.0, 1743.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Other", "Abstract", "Page Footer", "Reference text", "Table Note", "Section Header", "Equation label", "Figure Caption", "Table Caption", "Figure", "Page Header", "Table", "Equation"], "scores": [-4.9176659584, -5.9727334976, -6.0914320946, -7.208799839, -8.4028196335, -8.4461145401, -9.1980466843, -9.5783414841, -11.8105583191, -11.9973096848, -12.333067894, -12.6272134781, -12.7464570999, -13.3721008301], "content": "The Origins of Agent-Based Modeling. The true origins of any method or procedure are seldom identi\ufb01able in an unambiguous manner. In the case of agent-based model- ing, one could think of Craig Reynolds\u2019 1987 seminal article on the formation of bird \ufb02ocks (with the agents denoted as boids, short for \u201cbird-oid object\u201d), which he was able to represent with just three rules of behavior: (1) avoid collisions with nearby birds; (2) attempt to match the velocity of nearby birds; and (3) attempt to stay close to nearby birds in the \ufb02ock (Reynolds 1987; Gooding 2019). The result of simula- tions with this simple ABM was very realistic-looking \ufb02ocking behavior. Particularly intriguing in this study was the fact that there was no leader or a global organizing principle. Instead, the virtual birds were truly individual agents that self-organized locally, thereby generating a globally coherent \ufb02ight pattern. While Reynolds\u2019 work was a milestone, key concepts leading to modern ABMs can be found much earlier. One notable contributor of ideas was Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi, who used mechanical addition machines to generate probabilities for stochastic models with which he solved otherwise unwieldy problems (Gooding 2019). This procedure was an early form of the method of a Monte Carlo simulation, which was later independently developed and published by Stanislav Ulam, like Fermi a member of the Manhattan Project (Metropolis & Ulam 1949; Metropolis 1987). Another very important contribution to the budding development of ABMs was the Turing machine (Turing 1936), which is a mathematical model of computation that uses a set of rules to manipulate symbols in discrete cells on an in\ufb01nite tape. Much closer to ABMs were ideas of Ulam, who was fascinated by the \u201cautomatic\u201d emergence of patterns in two-dimensional games with very simple rules (Ulam 1950; Metropolis 1987).", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9876343608, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -4.9176659584}, {"pdf_name": "616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 3, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf_3_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 439.37, 666.142], "bounding_box": [999.0, 1791.0, 1117.0, 1823.0], "classes": ["Other", "Page Footer", "Section Header", "Table Note", "Body Text", "Figure Caption", "Table Caption", "Page Header", "Figure", "Reference text", "Abstract", "Table", "Equation", "Equation label"], "scores": [-4.3844189644, -4.7888255119, -7.5193200111, -9.0558834076, -9.5733909607, -10.5629796982, -10.9148025513, -11.4876241684, -11.7053499222, -12.1140651703, -12.1462783813, -12.5651540756, -13.1283416748, -14.5714921951], "content": "123", "postprocess_cls": "Page Footer", "postprocess_score": 0.9969034791, "detect_cls": "Other", "detect_score": -4.3844189644}, {"pdf_name": "616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 4, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf_4_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 439.37, 666.142], "bounding_box": [146.0, 97.0, 1118.0, 134.0], "classes": ["Page Header", "Table", "Table Caption", "Page Footer", "Figure Caption", "Figure", "Equation label", "Body Text", "Table Note", "Other", "Section Header", "Reference text", "Abstract", "Equation"], "scores": [-7.2041602135, -7.9640235901, -10.5496177673, -11.6773910522, -11.7734260559, -12.9220905304, -14.3869924545, -14.4911231995, -16.1489486694, -16.283575058, -16.3335456848, -17.765296936, -19.9808139801, -20.2586574554], "content": "101 Page 4 of 19 E.

A very appealing implementation of a cellular automaton was John Conway\u2019s famous Game of Life (Gardner 1970). The social sciences adopted computational methods in the 1960s for microanalytic simulations or, simply, micro-simulations (Gilbert & Troitzsch 2005; Gooding 2019). In contrast to today\u2019s ABMs, which use simple rules to recreate observed or unknown patterns, the agents in the original microsimulations acted according to empirical data (Bae 2016). The advantage of this strategy is that model analysis can reveal systemic behaviors under different realistic scenarios (Gooding 2019). A seminal paper in this context described generic segregation processes (Schelling 1971). Other agent-based modeling work in sociology and economics was gleaned from the biological ABM work of Smith (1982), who formulated Darwin\u2019s ideas of evolution as a computer simulation. This idea inspired Nelson & Winter to apply similar concepts and imple- mentations to market studies, where \ufb01rms were modeled like animals that followed speci\ufb01c routines. In particular, the \ufb01rms were in competition, and the market weeded out bad routines while rewarding the \ufb01ttest. Nelson & Winter\u2019s in\ufb02uential book An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change (Nelson & Winter 1982) strongly proposed the use of computer simulations, which today would fall within the scope of agent- based modeling. Their ideas led to a school of thought called evolutionary economics (Hanappi 2017). An early and particularly in\ufb02uential paper in this context tried to shed light on the stock market (Palmer 1994). Initially, ABMs of arti\ufb01cial life simulated simple homogeneous agents that acted like huge colonies of ants that could just move and eat in the pursuit of food. Somewhat more sophisticated, economic simulations used as the main agent homo economicus, a consistently rational human pursuing the optimization of some economic goal or utility with exclusive self-interest (Persky 1995). Based on these humble beginnings, sophistication in computing soon permitted heterogeneous agents and much more complicated landscapes than before. The successes in economics were so tantalizing that simulation studies eventually reached the most prestigious journals of economics and the social sciences (Axtell 1996; Epstein & Axtell 1996; Geanakoplos 2012; Hanappi 2017). Modern ABMs in economics are capable of capturing much of the complexity of macroeconomic systems (e.g., Caiani (2016)). Following directly the principles of cellular automata, Kauffman studied large grids with elements that changed features in a binary fashion (Kauffman 1993). For instance, a white agent could turn black, and this shift occurred according to Boolean rules that usually involved some or all neighboring grid points. Kauffman was able to demon- strate the emergence of complex patterns, such as oscillations and percolation. Starting in the 1980, Wolfram performed systematic studies of cellular automata, which led to his in\ufb02uential 2002 book A New Kind of Science (Wolfram 2002) that assigns cellular automata a wide range of applications in a variety of \ufb01elds.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9999761581, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": 0.4115330279}, {"pdf_name": "616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 4, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf_4_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 439.37, 666.142], "bounding_box": [146.0, 1652.0, 1117.0, 1746.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Equation label", "Figure Caption", "Reference text", "Figure", "Page Footer", "Section Header", "Page Header", "Abstract", "Table Note", "Other", "Equation", "Table", "Table Caption"], "scores": [-2.3717222214, -9.6186952591, -11.9675188065, -14.2147378922, -14.5134277344, -14.5292568207, -15.7163267136, -16.8527259827, -17.7851295471, -19.3383293152, -20.5311489105, -21.0566501617, -23.7182044983, -24.8686141968], "content": "Biological Applications of Agent-Based Modeling.

In some applications, interventions or treatments were addressed and therefore required the adaptation of agents to changing scenarios (Berry 2002).

This type of inference is based on large numbers of simulations, i.e., replicate experiments with the ABM using the same assumptions and parameters, and different experiments over which assumptions or parameter values are system- atically changed. Simulations of ABMs essentially always yield different outcomes, because movements, actions and interactions of agents with each other or with the environment are stochastic events. The inference of rules from simulation results is an abductive process (Voit 2019) that is challenging, because one can easily demonstrate that different rule sets may lead to the emergence of the same systemic behaviors, and because even numerous simulations seldom cover the entire repertoire of a system\u2019s possible responses. In fact, Hanappi (2017) warned: \u201cassumptions on microagents that play the role of axioms from which the aggregate patterns are derived need not\u2014and indeed never should\u2014be the end of ABM research.\u201d Arguably the greatest appeal of ABMs, and at the same time a treacherous pitfall, is their enormous \ufb02exibility, which is attributatble to the fact that any number of rules can be imposed on the agents, and that the environment may be very simple but can also be exceedingly complicated. For instance, the environment may exhibit gradients or even different individually programmable patches (Barth 2012; Gooding 2019) including importing geographic information systems (GIS) data to de\ufb01ne the characteristics of", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9998991489, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -3.6439669132}, {"pdf_name": "616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 5, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf_5_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 439.37, 666.142], "bounding_box": [999.0, 1791.0, 1117.0, 1823.0], "classes": ["Other", "Section Header", "Body Text", "Figure", "Equation", "Table", "Equation label", "Page Footer", "Page Header", "Table Note", "Figure Caption", "Reference text", "Abstract", "Table Caption"], "scores": [-4.7469201088, -8.2753591537, -8.2776889801, -8.5765581131, -10.7641010284, -11.1317176819, -11.1986560822, -12.0706329346, -13.0660266876, -13.1381826401, -13.6264867783, -13.7169542313, -14.2865762711, -14.3330421448], "content": "123", "postprocess_cls": "Page Footer", "postprocess_score": 0.7307606339, "detect_cls": "Other", "detect_score": -4.7469201088}, {"pdf_name": "616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 6, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf_6_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 439.37, 666.142], "bounding_box": [146.0, 97.0, 1118.0, 134.0], "classes": ["Page Header", "Table", "Figure", "Section Header", "Table Caption", "Equation label", "Reference text", "Other", "Body Text", "Figure Caption", "Page Footer", "Equation", "Table Note", "Abstract"], "scores": [-5.9755821228, -8.6758537292, -11.9280195236, -14.0328226089, -14.1794605255, -15.3099689484, -15.5913076401, -15.8827428818, -16.0075893402, -17.2149906158, -17.6036815643, -17.610370636, -21.2260112762, -21.2646427155], "content": "101 Page 6 of 19 E.

Related to this option of adding elements is the critique that ABMs can be \u2018tuned\u2019 by researchers to create outcomes that support the researcher\u2019s narrative (Gooding 2019). To counteract increases in complexity, some authors have begun to develop methods of model reduction that retain the core features of a model, but elim- inate unnecessary details (Zou 2012). Another critique of ABMs is that simulations are not readily reproducible, because the rules can be complicated and stochasticity rarely repeats the same model trajectories. A strategy to increase the reproducibility of ABMs was the establishment of protocols for the standardized design and analysis of ABMs (Lorek & Sonnenschein 1999; Grimm 2006, 2010; Heard 2015).", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9986195564, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -1.8025705814}, {"pdf_name": "616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 6, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf_6_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 439.37, 666.142], "bounding_box": [146.0, 671.0, 1118.0, 1111.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Abstract", "Figure Caption", "Section Header", "Figure", "Other", "Table Note", "Page Footer", "Equation label", "Reference text", "Page Header", "Table Caption", "Table", "Equation"], "scores": [-5.1693220139, -12.2958726883, -14.7038059235, -16.2142829895, -16.5680294037, -17.5685920715, -17.8498764038, -18.3281955719, -19.1085147858, -19.9020843506, -20.6540737152, -22.5466785431, -24.4260787964, -28.2906646729], "content": "Support of ABMs from the Scienti\ufb01c Community.

However, using ABMs in this way is much like using a cell phone to hammer nails (q.v., Theobald (2004)): It may work in the desired fashion, but represents an utter waste of the tool\u2019s real potential. Adding just one more step, the collection of model-generated data, transforms a passive learning experience into an active one. Students can be asked to calculate means and variances, graph relationships between variables, discuss the sample size needed for reliable results, and generate quantitative predictions under different hypotheses, all in the context of a speci\ufb01c biological question. This can be done even in a large classroom with only a single, instructor-controlled computer, bridging the gap between lecture and lab. If students have access to individual computers, much more is possible. Either individually or in small groups, students can use ABMs to collect and analyze their own data. Free \ufb01le-sharing resources such as GoogleDocs make it easy to pool data across many groups, thereby crowd-sourcing problems that would be too large for any one group to handle on their own. In smaller classes and lab sections, individuals or groups can be assigned to model different scenarios (e.g., the interaction effects between different parameters), prompting discussions of the most appropriate parameter values and model settings. Such models can even be extended into miniature research projects. For example, in a unit on community ecology, students might be assigned a question about two interacting species, then use online resources to \ufb01nd relevant information and parameter estimates, design and conduct a series of model runs, analyze their data using simple statistical techniques, and present their \ufb01ndings to the class.

An example of a course where ABMs are the only type of modeling being used is given by Bodine (2019); this course has only a single prerequisite: either a prior math modeling course which introduces basic computer programming or an introduction to computer science course. The use of biological applications in teaching mathematical modeling (includ- ing modeling with ABMs) is often viewed as having a lower entry point with less new vocabulary overhead than other types of applications (e.g., those from physics, chemistry, or economics).

Students at early stages of their aca- demic career often envision science as a collection of factual information and \ufb01xed procedures. Students with this mindset may dismiss as useless any model that does not incorporate every detail of a particular biological system. By contrast, scientists recognize that models, whether mathematical, physical, or conceptual, are deliber- ate simpli\ufb01cations that attempt to capture certain properties of a biological system while ignoring others (Dahlquist 2017). For example, the standard epidemiological SIR model (diagrammed in Fig. 1a) divides a population in three subpopulations (sus- ceptible, infectious, and removed) while ignoring any potential heterogeneity within each subpopulation (e.g., age, treatment status, groups at higher risk for transmission). Students will need to engage in activities that frame the ABM as a hypothesis about the organization and function of a speci\ufb01c biological system (Weisstein 2011). After a description (and possible exploration) of the basic model, students can work in groups to suggest additional processes and variables that seem relevant to under- standing the system. They can then choose one or two of the factors that they consider most important to addressing the question being asked. Finally, they should consider how to modify the model to incorporate the chosen features. For example, a standard epidemiological model divides the host population into susceptible, infectious, and removed subpopulations, and studies the movement of individuals among these sub- populations (Fig. 1a). A group of students decides to modify this model to track a malarial epidemic. After discussing mortality rates, prevention and treatment options, and genetic and age-related variation in host susceptibility, the students decide to focus on incorporating vector transmission into their model. Through guided discus- sion with the instructor, they realize that transmission now occurs in two directions: from infected vectors to susceptible hosts and from infected hosts to uninfected vec- tors. They therefore develop a schematic model (Fig. 1b) that depicts these revised rules for each agent in the ABM.

The concept of an equation is introduced fairly early in mathematics education. In the United States, children can encounter simple alge- braic equations in elementary school (Common Core 2019) and then continue to see increasingly complex equations in math classes through college. Because of this long exposure to equations, the use of functions and systems of equations to model systems in the natural world feels \u201cnatural\u201d or logical to students when they \ufb01rst encounter differential equation models or matrix models. ABMs, on the other hand, can seem confusing to students because they lack the ability to be expressed as an equation or set of equations. An ABM is constructed as an algorithm describing when and how each agent interacts with their local environment (which may include other agents). Often these interactions are governed by stochastic processes, and thus \u201cdecisions\u201d by agents are made through the generation of random numbers. When \ufb01rst introducing students to ABMs, it can be helpful to teach students how to read and construct computer program \ufb02owcharts and to create a visual representation of what is occurring within an algorithm or portion of an algorithm (see Bodine (2019) for example assignments that utilize program \ufb02owchart construction). In life science classes where ABMs are being analyzed but not constructed and implemented, a \ufb02ow diagram can be a use- ful tool for conveying the order processes occur in the model. Class discussions can question whether the order of processes make biological sense, and whether there are alternatives. In math modeling classes, the construction of \ufb02owcharts, even for simple ABMs, can help students elucidate where decision points are within the code, and what procedures are repeated through loop structures.

One of the most exciting moments for students when they \ufb01rst begin running simulations of an ABM is seeing system- level patterns emerge before their eyes. One of the challenges for students (and agent- based modelers, in general) is to develop algorithms to identify and/or quantify the patterns we can easily identify by sight. For example, in the \ufb02ocking ABM discussed above, an observer watching the locations of individual agents change at each time step can easily see the formation of \ufb02ocks. If however, the observer wanted to systematically explore the parameter space of the \ufb02ocking ABM and determine the regions of the parameter space under which \ufb02ocking occurs (a process which might involve running hundreds or thousands of simulations), it would be a tedious and time-consuming task to physically watch each simulation and record whether the agents formed a \ufb02ock or not. Instead, the observer must choose the criteria that indicate the formation of a \ufb02ock, and then determine a measure or an algorithm for determining whether a \ufb02ock (or multiple \ufb02ocks) have formed. In a course designed to teach the construction and analysis of ABMs, this is a point where students should be encouraged to be both creative and methodical about developing such measures and algorithms. The development of these observational measures and algorithms also provides a great opportunity for collaboration between students. It is especially helpful if students with a diversity of academic backgrounds can be brought together to brainstorm ideas; for instance, mixing students with various levels of exposure in mathematics, computer science, and biology can be very bene\ufb01cial.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9997158647, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -5.8333945274}, {"pdf_name": "616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 14, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf_14_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 439.37, 666.142], "bounding_box": [147.0, 1269.0, 341.0, 1292.0], "classes": ["Section Header", "Body Text", "Reference text", "Page Header", "Page Footer", "Equation label", "Other", "Equation", "Table Caption", "Figure", "Table Note", "Table", "Figure Caption", "Abstract"], "scores": [-1.4911371469, -5.3806667328, -6.5733017921, -7.2363605499, -8.9930868149, -9.2655143738, -9.5961027145, -10.3777217865, -10.5674705505, -11.4295864105, -11.7405233383, -11.8207111359, -11.9145345688, -13.8188343048], "content": "5 Conclusions", "postprocess_cls": "Section Header", "postprocess_score": 0.9998745918, "detect_cls": "Section Header", "detect_score": -1.4911371469}, {"pdf_name": "616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 14, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/616e372467467f7269d2de14.pdf_14_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 439.37, 666.142], "bounding_box": [146.0, 1341.0, 1119.0, 1746.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Equation label", "Page Footer", "Reference text", "Section Header", "Abstract", "Figure", "Other", "Table Note", "Page Header", "Figure Caption", "Table", "Equation", "Table Caption"], "scores": [-0.2872071266, -14.6426448822, -15.2004051208, -15.5859422684, -15.7333631516, -16.9184551239, -18.7717189789, -18.8031005859, -18.8901405334, -20.1505947113, -20.6487941742, -25.1231861115, -25.53399086, -26.6132926941], "content": "Rapid advances in computing power over the past decades have made agent-based modeling a feasible and appealing tool to study biological systems.
