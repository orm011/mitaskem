In the next article with the title \u2018\u2018COVID-19 classification by CC- SHNet with deep fusion using transfer learning and discriminant cor- relation analysis\u2019\u2019 [3], the authors designed and developed a novel advanced AI system for COVID-19 classification based on chest CT (CCT) images. They first used a novel (L, 2) transfer feature learning algorithmtoextractfeatureswithahyperparameterofnumberoflayers to be removed. Second, a selection algorithm of pretrained network for fusion was proposed to choose the best two models. Third, deep CCT fusion by discriminant correlation analysis was proposed to help fuse the two features from two models. From the test on the dataset, it proved that the new model named as CCSHNet was effective in detecting COVID-19 and other lung infectious diseases. It could assist radiologiststomakethefinaldiagnosisdecisions.

Multiple factors were constructed for characteris- tics measurement of peer engagement. Particularly, a more refined alternative measurement of informativeness was proposed through a deep-learning-based sentiment analysis. The empirical results showed that during epidemics, synchronicity was much higher, and group diversity and experts had stronger effects in lowering synchronicity, while the effects of informativeness and information diffusion were hampered.

The pro- posed CNN was a lightweight model that had less than 0.4 million parameters. Features from different layers of the CNN were fused using a multilayer perceptron. The proposed method achieved a very high information density compared to other existing methods using pretrainedCNNmodels.

Theseventharticle,\u2018\u2018Multimodalfeature-wiseco-attentionmethod for visual question answering\u2019\u2019 [7], proposed a feature-wise attention mechanism for visual question answering (VQA) to extract more dis- criminative representations for image and question modalities. The authors designed novel modules to model the inter-modal feature- wise attention, and combine the visual spatial attention with feature- wise attention to develop a new network model for VQA. The ex- perimentalresultsdemonstratedthattheproposedapproachachieved the state-of-the-art performance on two large-scale, real-world VQA datasets.

Then, the Skip-Gram model wasusedtogeneratethenumericalsymptom(medicine)embeddings, which were divided into seven communities (syndromes) by Spectral Clusteringalgorithm.Fromtheexperimentalresults,theauthorsproved that this model could effectively identify the critical symptoms and symptom distribution for diagnosis. It could provide tremendously valuableguidanceforcombattingtheCOVID-19.
