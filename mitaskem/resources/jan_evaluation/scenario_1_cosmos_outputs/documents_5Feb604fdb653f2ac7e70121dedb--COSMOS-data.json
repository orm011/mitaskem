"Article history: While the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to threaten public Received 30 November 2020 health and safety, every state has strategically reopened the business

In Available online 23 February 2021 this study, a novel SEIR model was developed to evaluate the effect of reopening policies Handling editor: Dr. J Wu based on the real-world reported COVID-19 data in Texas. The earlier reported data before the reopening were used to develop the SEIR model; data after the reopening were used Keywords: for evaluation. The simulation results show that if continuing the \u201cstay-at-home order\u201d COVID-19 pandemic without reopening the business, the COVID-19 pandemic could end in December 2020 in SEIR model Texas. On the other hand, the pandemic could be controlled similarly as the case of no- Texas state reopening only if the contact rate was low and additional high magnitude of control Reopening business Infectious disease transmission measures could be implemented. If the control measures are only slightly enhanced after reopening, it could \ufb02atten the curve of the COVID-19 epidemic with reduced numbers of infections and deaths, but it might make the epidemic last longer. Based on the reported data up to July 2020 in Texas, the real-world epidemic pattern is between the cases of the low and high magnitude of control measures with a medium risk of contact rate after reopening. In this case, the pandemic might last until summer 2021 to February 2022 with a total of 4e10 million infected cases and 20,080e58,604 deaths. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Among all the counties and regions, the United States has been the most worrisome country which has the most con\ufb01rmed cases and deaths. The number of cases and deaths reached to more than 7 million and 200, 000 respectively in October 2020. Due to the absence of vaccine and treatment, the prevention and control of COVID-19 have mainly relied on behavioral prevention measures, which include keeping social distance, wearing masks, stay-at-home order, and closure of nonessential business (Yu et al., 2017). In the United States, most of the states had declared a state of emergency and issued a stay-at-home order. Although many people have been prevented from infection through social distancing strategies, tens of millions of unemployment claims have been \ufb01led during COVID-19 outbreak in the United States (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics). As more and more people want to return to work, slowing down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 becomes more challenging. Recently, the stay-at-home order has been lifted across the country and some business restrictions have also been relaxed (CNN, 2020). Since the pandemic has not been completely controlled, the daily new con\ufb01rmed cases are continually reported, it is urgent to evaluate the effect of the reopening policies on the COVID-19 pandemic to help manage the future medical resources and control measures. It has been observed that the number of daily con\ufb01rmed cases is approaching another peak after the reopening policies are released in several states, including Texas, Alabama and South Dakota (COVID-19 tracking project (The Atlantic, The Covid Tracking Project, 2020)). For example, between April 10th and 30th, 2020, the numbers of daily con\ufb01rmed cases were never greater than 1000 in Texas (Texas DSHS, Texas COVID-19, 20202), but the average number of daily con\ufb01rmed cases between April 30th and May 16th, 2020 was 1173, in particular, the number of daily con\ufb01rmed cases approached 1801 on May 16th, 2020 after a reopening policy was implemented (Texas DSHS, Texas COVID-19 Data, 2020). The increase in number of daily con\ufb01rmed cases after reopening was likely due to the increased contact rate of susceptible people with infected cases. But it is not clear whether there is a second wave of outbreak and what the total number of cases will reach after reopening. It is crucial to understand the effect of reopening policies on the pandemic to prevent more infections. The pandemic situation in different states and counties are different and the local governments make their own decisions on when and how to reopen the business. In this study, we mainly focused on evaluating the reopening policies in Texas, although the methodologies in this paper are applicable to other states or regions in general. As for disease transmission, different mathematical models and statistical methods have been applied to predict the future trend, which include multivariate linear regression (Thomson et al., 2006), grey forecasting method (Wang, 2018), time series techniques and neural networks (Liu et al., 2016) and the susceptible/exposed/infective/recovered (SEIR) model (Sanyi et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2017) among others. In particular, the SEIR model is the most popular mathematical model which have been employed to study the COVID-19 pandemic since its outbreak in China (Afonso et al., 2020; Das et al., 2020; He et al., 2020; L\u0013opez & Rodo, 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Zhan et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020). In this study, we proposed a modi\ufb01ed SEIR model to study the COVID-19 epidemic in Texas. Using the proposed model, we estimated the COVID-19 epidemic parameters based on the data of reported infected cases and deaths in Texas, and predicted the future epidemics of COVID-19 under different reopening policies. The results of this study can help the local governments make decisions on pandemic control and future reopening policies.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9998471737, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": 0.2596454024}, {"pdf_name": "604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 3, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf_3_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 544.252, 742.677], "bounding_box": [1278.0, 1403.0, 1305.0, 1425.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Equation label", "Page Header", "Figure Caption", "Figure", "Section Header", "Reference text", "Equation", "Table", "Page Footer", "Other", "Table Note", "Table Caption", "Abstract"], "scores": [-3.7923767567, -4.5748443604, -6.120402813, -6.8514809608, -7.096186161, -10.6980161667, -12.5471448898, -12.6276741028, -13.3343267441, -14.05727005, -14.5403623581, -15.6577968597, -15.7425060272, -15.9960212708], "content": "(1)", "postprocess_cls": "Equation label", "postprocess_score": 0.9755915403, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -3.7923767567}, {"pdf_name": "604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 3, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf_3_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 544.252, 742.677], "bounding_box": [1278.0, 1474.0, 1305.0, 1495.0], "classes": ["Equation label", "Page Header", "Figure", "Figure Caption", "Table", "Body Text", "Equation", "Reference text", "Other", "Abstract", "Section Header", "Table Caption", "Page Footer", "Table Note"], "scores": [-4.0584764481, -6.2188634872, -10.7545051575, -11.0366487503, -11.1131868362, -11.4013767242, -12.3925437927, -12.704659462, -13.7399368286, -13.8235788345, -14.3011426926, -14.7653474808, -17.6059951782, -17.8652439117], "content": "(2)", "postprocess_cls": "Equation label", "postprocess_score": 0.9733932018, "detect_cls": "Equation label", "detect_score": -4.0584764481}, {"pdf_name": "604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 3, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf_3_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 544.252, 742.677], "bounding_box": [100.0, 1152.0, 419.0, 1169.0], "classes": ["Page Header", "Figure", "Page Footer", "Equation label", "Section Header", "Body Text", "Figure Caption", "Reference text", "Other", "Equation", "Table", "Table Note", "Table Caption", "Abstract"], "scores": [-6.1337070465, -6.6882481575, -7.3348889351, -7.5550603867, -7.5778913498, -8.0883550644, -9.3337612152, -10.4660367966, -10.7961111069, -11.6748971939, -12.0086250305, -14.7466897964, -14.8273544312, -14.9943504333], "content": "SEIR model and estimation method", "postprocess_cls": "Section Header", "postprocess_score": 0.9997286201, "detect_cls": "Page Header", "detect_score": -6.1337070465}, {"pdf_name": "604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 3, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf_3_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 544.252, 742.677], "bounding_box": [1278.0, 1531.0, 1305.0, 1553.0], "classes": ["Equation label", "Page Header", "Body Text", "Figure", "Table", "Other", "Equation", "Figure Caption", "Abstract", "Section Header", "Reference text", "Table Caption", "Table Note", "Page Footer"], "scores": [-3.8889210224, -8.4461517334, -10.3233661652, -10.737988472, -11.0656003952, -11.3999242783, -11.4036903381, -11.4549703598, -12.7631053925, -12.787115097, -13.1736297607, -14.2259283066, -16.6828250885, -17.3348045349], "content": "(3)", "postprocess_cls": "Equation label", "postprocess_score": 0.9904330969, "detect_cls": "Equation label", "detect_score": -3.8889210224}, {"pdf_name": "604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 3, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf_3_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 544.252, 742.677], "bounding_box": [100.0, 1207.0, 1307.0, 1362.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Table Note", "Page Footer", "Equation label", "Abstract", "Figure", "Figure Caption", "Reference text", "Section Header", "Other", "Table Caption", "Page Header", "Table", "Equation"], "scores": [-1.79426682, -7.6713447571, -8.7761726379, -8.9450120926, -8.9464988708, -8.9991397858, -9.03236866, -10.9594984055, -10.9882698059, -12.0271692276, -12.946811676, -13.1038255692, -13.6723508835, -15.6257801056], "content": "We assume that the overall population can be divided into nine compartments: susceptible individuals (S), exposed in- dividuals who are not quarantined (E), exposed and quarantined individuals (Eq), infected individuals with symptoms (Is), infected individuals with no symptoms (Ia), con\ufb01rmed cases who are quarantined at home (H1), con\ufb01rmed cases who are hospitalized (H2), recovered individuals (R), and individuals who died (D).

keeps constant, i.e., no migration is considered. The in- dividuals in the infected components, Is and Ia, are the only groups to infect the susceptible people. The transmission dynamic is modelled as follows (see the \ufb02owchart in Fig. 1). Susceptible individuals, S, could become the exposed individuals who were not quarantined, E, after they were exposed to infected individuals Is and Ia, see equation (1) where c1\u00f0t\u00de and c2\u00f0t\u00de denote the contact rate of infected people with symptoms and without symptoms, respectively. The exposed individuals (E) further could move to the quarantined, infected and susceptible components with different rates, respectively. Speci\ufb01cally, they could move to exposed and quarantined component Eq with a quarantine rate q\u00f0t\u00de, to infected components, Is and Ia, with an infection rate s, and the susceptible component S with a rate m. Individuals in component Eq could become infectious with an infection rate b (Mizumoto et al., 2020). Note that the compartment consisting of exposed individuals (E) is different from the traditional SEIR model (Aron & Schwartz, 1984; Sanyi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), where the exposed individuals are those infected patients but not yet infectious. Here we de\ufb01ne the exposed individuals as those who literally contacted with the infected individuals and have not been infected yet. The infected patients with symptoms were detected to become con\ufb01rmed cases and moved to con\ufb01rmed and quarantined component H1 with a rate ds\u00f0t\u00de. The detection rate for infected people with no symptoms is da\u00f0t\u00de: Individuals who were infected without symptoms could move to the symptomatic infected component Is with a rate u2ga or recovered component R with a rate\u00f01 \u0000u2\u00dega: Individuals who were con\ufb01rmed cases and quarantined at home could move to hospitalized component H2 and recovered component R with a rate g1. Hospitalized patients could move to recovered and death component, R and D, with a rate g2. The recovered cases cannot be infected again. In this model, u1 denotes the proportion of con\ufb01rmed infected people with mild symptoms (no need for hospitalization) (Covid & Team, 2020); u3 denotes the probability of con\ufb01rmed cases quarantined at home becoming to be hospitalized; u4 denotes the proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who recovered (Richardson et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020); u5 is the proportion of the patients who were con\ufb01rmed with infection and quarantined at home. We assume some parameters to be time varying to re\ufb02ect the real world change due to policy changes, such as the contact rate, detection rate, quarantine rate and death rate.

In addition, all the unknown parameters were constrained with pre-de\ufb01ned lower and upper bounds (see Table 2). The interior-point method was used to optimize the loss function (18), and implemented with MATLAB. To evaluate the effect of \ufb01xed parameters and initial values on the estimation results, sensitivity analyses were performed. For the \ufb01xed parameters u1 and s, we selected 6 values around the default value for each parameter in Table 1. Then, a total of 36 different combinations of the \ufb01xed parameters were used to re\ufb01t the model. For the initial values of parameters, each time we randomly selected one value around the estimated value for each parameter as the new initial value. Then we re\ufb01tted the model using the generated new initial values. After repeating above steps for 800 times, we obtained the estimation results from the 800 different initial value sets. The distribution of the objective function values can be used to evaluate whether the solution is optimal. The comparison of prediction results under different parameter settings is another way to assess the in\ufb02uence of parameters on modelling results. If the prediction results are close, we can conclude that our model prediction is robust for the variation of parameters. Once the model is established and model parameters are estimated, we simulated the COVID-19 epidemic in Texas under the assumption of different reopening policies. The simulation focused on the effect of different reopening magnitudes on the COVID-19 epidemics in Texas. In the simulations, the timing of actual Texas reopening policies was used. Texas has imple- mented three phases of reopening which were effective on May 1st, May 18th and June 3rd, 2020 respectively (KHOU, 2020). Due to the increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, Texas governor announced the temporary pause of additional reopening on June 25th.

The patient was a man in his 70s who travelled aboard and returned to Texas with symptoms, then was hospitalized immediately after diagnosis. Therefore, we assumed the initial value of the number of hospitalized individuals as 1 on March 4th, 2020. The initial value of the number of susceptible individuals was assumed as the whole Texas population (N \u00bc 28,995,881). In addition, we \ufb01xed some of the model parameters based on literature in order to alleviate the model identi\ufb01ability problem (see Table 1). With the constrained least squares (LS) method, the rest of the unknown parameters in the ODE system were estimated based on reported number of con\ufb01rmed cases and deaths in Texas which are shown at Table 2. The proposed model \ufb01ts the observed COVID-19 data from Match 4th to April 28th, 2020 very well (see Fig. 2). To further valid the model \ufb01tting, we performed sensitivity analyses against both \ufb01xed parameters and the initial values of parameters (see Figures S3eS10 in the supplemental material). It shows that the model \ufb01tting and prediction results are quite robust to the variations of \ufb01xed parameters and initial values. We also notice that our \ufb01nal parameter es- timates may not be the best solution in terms of the objective function in the sensitivity analyses, but they are very close to the optimal point. We modelled the reopening policy with three levels of risk, i.e., low, medium and high risks that are quanti\ufb01ed by the contact rate with infected individuals without symptoms (we assume that the effective contact rate with infected individuals with symptoms could be ignored).

We quanti\ufb01ed the \u201clow-risk\u201d reopening policy as the contact rate increased by 2 times on May 1st, 3 times on May 18th, 4 times on June 3rd, then reduced to 3 times on June 25th, 2020 due to the reopening pause. The medium and high-risk reopening policies were similarly de\ufb01ned but with a larger magnitude of change in the contact rate after reopening. For each level of the reopening risk, we simulated three scenarios of the control measures based on the quarantine rate and detection rates, i.e., 1) no change of control measures; 2) low magnitude of control measures where the quarantine and detection rates increased by 1.5 folds; and 3) high magnitude of control measures where the quarantine and detection rates increased by 2 folds. The detailed simulation design for the Texas reopening policy are summarized in Table 3.

For the medium risk of reopening case (i.e., the effective contact rate only increased by 3e5 folds after reopening), all the simulation results show that the pandemic would resurge rapidly after reopening. Among the three cases with different magnitudes of control measures, the high magnitude of control measures (the detection rates and quarantine rate were enhanced by 2-folds) could delay the timing of next pandemic wave and reduce the wave magnitude signi\ufb01cantly, i.e., the epidemic curve could be \ufb02attened (see the curve S23 in Figs. 5 and 6). However, if there were no additional control measures adopted after reopening in this case, the number of daily COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths could dramatically increase to the peak in early July 2020 (see the curve S21 in Fig. 5). If the low magnitude of control measures were imple- mented (the detection rates and quarantine rate were enhanced by 1.5-folds), the pandemic would start to get worse in the middle of June and reach to the peak later in August 2020, but the peak would be much lower than the case without additional control measures (see the curve S22 in Figs. 5 and 6). Fortunately, the real-world reported con\ufb01rmed new cases and deaths in Texas (stars in Figs. 5 and 6) were between S22 and S23, which might indicate that the medium control measures might have been implemented (i.e., the detection rates and quarantine rate were enhanced between 1.5-folds and 2-folds). On the contrary, for the high-risk reopening policy (i.e., the effective contact rate increased by 4e6 folds after reopening), our simulation results show that the COVID-19 epidemic could not be controlled by even the high magnitude of control measures, and the epidemic could rapidly move to a new wave and different control measures barely had any effect on the timing of next big wave, but only reduced the magnitude of the wave (see Figures S1eS2 in the supplemental material). We also simulated the complete COVID-19 epidemic trajectories until the end of the epidemic in Texas for different scenarios as described above. The \ufb01nal results are summarized in Table 4.

After the reopening policy was implemented, the pandemic could still be under control only if the reopening is a low-risk with a high magnitude of control measures adopted (2-folds increase in the detection rates and quarantine rate), see the curves of S13 in Figs. 3 and 4. In this case, the pandemic will end in November 2020 and the total number of infected cases, hospitalizations and deaths would be similar to the case without reopening (see Table 4). However, if no any control measures were enhanced after reopening, even under the low risk case, the pandemic might last for one more year, probably end in October 2021 with 49,651 in death toll and more than 37% of the Texas population infected. If only a low magnitude of control measures was implemented (1.5-folds increase in the detection rates and quarantine rate), the pandemic might last many years (until spring 2024), but with a smaller death toll, hospitalization and infection counts (see the case S12 in Table 4) compared to the case without additional control measures (the case S11 in Table 4). If the reopening policy was implemented on May 1st, 2020 with a medium risk of contact (i.e., the effective contact rate increased by 3e5 folds after reopening) and no additional control measures were implemented after reopening, COVID-19 pandemic might end in April 2021 with a signi\ufb01cantly higher total death (101,305) and as many as more than 50% of Texas population could be infected. However, if the additional control measures were implemented (1.5 to 2-folds increase in the detection rates and quarantine rate), COVID-19 pandemic could last longer (end in June 2021 or February 2022), but the total number of deaths, hospitalizations and infected cases could be signi\ufb01cantly reduced (see cases S22 and S23 in Table 4) compared to the case with no change of controls measures (S21). Particularly, the total deaths could be reduced by more than 40% if the control measures could increase by 1.5-folds and more than 80% if the control measures could increase by 2-folds. If the reopening policy was implemented on May 1st, 2020 with a high-risk of contact (the effective contact rate increased by 4e6 folds after reopening), COVID-19 pandemic might last for one year (end in spring 2021), but it would result in 10e17 million infections and as high as 142,578 deaths (if no additional control measures were adopted), which is a pandemic disaster.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9984397292, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -4.3130435944}, {"pdf_name": "604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 11, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf_11_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 544.252, 742.677], "bounding_box": [689.0, 1820.0, 716.0, 1833.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Section Header", "Page Footer", "Figure Caption", "Table Caption", "Figure", "Table", "Table Note", "Page Header", "Equation label", "Other", "Equation", "Reference text", "Abstract"], "scores": [-5.1109981537, -8.0355205536, -8.7366828918, -9.1234827042, -9.3576173782, -10.7658071518, -10.8386459351, -10.9076194763, -11.4116382599, -12.0133047104, -12.6353731155, -13.7271127701, -15.2299470901, -15.7907142639], "content": "470", "postprocess_cls": "Page Footer", "postprocess_score": 0.9999854565, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -5.1109981537}, {"pdf_name": "604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 12, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf_12_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 544.252, 742.677], "bounding_box": [100.0, 89.0, 306.0, 106.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Page Header", "Figure Caption", "Figure", "Equation label", "Section Header", "Page Footer", "Reference text", "Table Note", "Equation", "Other", "Table Caption", "Table", "Abstract"], "scores": [-3.0085575581, -7.5684967041, -8.4447526932, -12.7600708008, -13.6475973129, -15.7316141129, -19.5288295746, -21.440788269, -22.3416614532, -24.7485771179, -24.8558673859, -27.1237659454, -27.5133953094, -28.6856441498], "content": "D.

To estimate the model parameters, we used the number of reported con\ufb01rmed cases and deaths before the reopening policies were implemented, speci\ufb01cally, the data between March 4th (the \ufb01rst documented COVID-19 case in Texas) and April 28th, 2020 (the day right after the announcement of Phase 1 reopening policy). Our model \ufb01ts the reported data very well (Fig. 2). Based on the estimated model, we simulated the effect of different reopening policies on COVID-19 pandemic in Texas. To our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst study to investigate the effect of reopening policies in Texas, USA, using a data-driven SEIR transmission model. According to the estimated SEIR model, if the \u201cstay-at-home order\u201d continued without reopening policy, COVID-19 pandemic could be controlled by the end of 2020 with the lowest number of infected cases, deaths and hospitalizations in Texas. If the reopening policy with strong control and protection measures, i.e., the effective contact rate is low, but the detection rates and quarantine rate were enhanced by 2-folds or higher, the COVID-19 epidemic could be similarly controlled as the case without reopening. However, the data of reported con\ufb01rmed cases and deaths show that the COVID-19 epidemic in Texas is much worse than these promising cases. If no any additional control and protection measures could be implemented after reopening, the COVID-19 epidemic would result in a rapid pandemic wave with signi\ufb01cantly higher numbers of infected cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Additional control and protection measures with different magnitudes could \ufb02atten the epidemic curve and reduce the number of infected cases, hospitalizations and deaths, but the low magnitude of control and protection measures could make COVID-19 last longer. For example, the low-risk reopening with a low magnitude of control measures (the case S12 in Table 4) could make the pandemic last for four years (up to March 2024). In this case, the COVID-19 epidemic curve could be \ufb02attened with a reduced number of infections, but the effect of COVID-19 epidemic on economy would also last longer.", "postprocess_cls": "Abstract", "postprocess_score": 0.5618848205, "detect_cls": "Abstract", "detect_score": -6.2794055939}, {"pdf_name": "604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 12, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf_12_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 544.252, 742.677], "bounding_box": [689.0, 1820.0, 714.0, 1833.0], "classes": ["Reference text", "Page Header", "Page Footer", "Table", "Equation label", "Body Text", "Figure", "Figure Caption", "Section Header", "Table Caption", "Table Note", "Equation", "Other", "Abstract"], "scores": [-1.7864474058, -2.1527462006, -2.3463644981, -3.4242939949, -3.5275504589, -4.7654237747, -4.8638429642, -5.0595445633, -5.1896276474, -5.2221374512, -5.3986539841, -5.7027444839, -5.9196138382, -6.1270990372], "content": "471", "postprocess_cls": "Page Footer", "postprocess_score": 0.9998508692, "detect_cls": "Reference text", "detect_score": -1.7864474058}, {"pdf_name": "604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 13, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf_13_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 544.252, 742.677], "bounding_box": [100.0, 89.0, 306.0, 106.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Table Note", "Page Header", "Figure", "Equation label", "Figure Caption", "Table Caption", "Page Footer", "Section Header", "Reference text", "Table", "Other", "Abstract", "Equation"], "scores": [-4.5859079361, -6.2467074394, -6.7090845108, -8.4606409073, -9.2227964401, -10.1715669632, -10.8941402435, -11.2936315536, -12.3498086929, -13.2943983078, -13.4754285812, -15.6316957474, -17.6557865143, -18.4358596802], "content": "D.

In this case, the pandemic might last until summer 2021 to February 2022 with a total of 4e10 million infected cases and 20,080e58,604 deaths at the end of epidemic. However, if the COVID-19 epidemic continued in other states of USA and the cross-state transmission could not stopped, this result could be affected and changed. The COVID-19 epidemic trajectories could also be affected by new control policies, vaccines and effective treatments in the future. In this study, the proposed SEIR model shows goodness-of-\ufb01t to the reported COVID-19 data before reopening in April 2020, and captured the epidemic trend of COVID-19 after reopening in Texas. We also recognize some limitations of the proposed model and model assumptions. We did not consider the population migration and movement between states in the model. However, since the outbreak of COVID-19, travel restrictions have been implemented and signi\ufb01cant cross-state migration and movement could be ignored reasonably. We also assumed that the patients who were con\ufb01rmed and quar- antined at home or hospitalized did not infect others. Due to the data limitation, we also ignored the COVID-19 patients who were dead at home. In the model, we did not consider some big events of gathering, such as annual rodeo and the \u2018black life matters\u2019 parade in big cities, that might have a signi\ufb01cant effect on COVID-19 epidemic. Most importantly, the proposed SEIR model suffers the model identi\ufb01ability problem since the data only for the con\ufb01rmed infected cases and deaths were available and reliable. The data for the number of hospitalizations and recovered patients were available, but were estimated and not reliable. To alleviate this problem, we \ufb01xed some of the model parameters based on the literature and used strong constraints for some of the parameters in the parameter estimation. To valid the simulation results in terms of the choices of the \ufb01xed parameters and initial values for model \ufb01tting, intensive sensitivity analyses were performed. From Figures S3eS10 in the supplemental material we observed that the prediction results are robust to different choices of the \ufb01xed parameters and initial values. This study aims to extend the SEIR model to assess the effect of reopening policies on the COVID-19 epidemic, instead of for accurate predictions of epidemics. The established model can be used to simulate the consequences of different scenarios for different policy changes, which could be used as an evidence-driven guidance for decision-makers to assess the trade-off among different policies. Although our model was developed based on the COVID-19 data of Texas, it could be easily adapted and generalized to other states of USA and other countries.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9979433417, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -4.0085010529}, {"pdf_name": "604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 13, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf_13_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 544.252, 742.677], "bounding_box": [101.0, 1304.0, 450.0, 1325.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Equation label", "Section Header", "Figure", "Page Header", "Reference text", "Page Footer", "Figure Caption", "Equation", "Table Note", "Other", "Table", "Table Caption", "Abstract"], "scores": [-2.7883636951, -4.0243439674, -5.1694555283, -5.2677497864, -6.7072706223, -7.0829749107, -7.1590213776, -7.9103851318, -8.7207107544, -9.045165062, -9.6408376694, -10.4788618088, -11.2339944839, -11.7293148041], "content": "Declaration of competing interest", "postprocess_cls": "Section Header", "postprocess_score": 0.9972727895, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -2.7883636951}, {"pdf_name": "604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 13, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf_13_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 544.252, 742.677], "bounding_box": [132.0, 1358.0, 726.0, 1379.0], "classes": ["Reference text", "Body Text", "Page Header", "Section Header", "Figure", "Abstract", "Equation", "Equation label", "Table", "Other", "Page Footer", "Figure Caption", "Table Caption", "Table Note"], "scores": [-3.9888226986, -6.4135284424, -7.2039923668, -7.4483017921, -7.8825597763, -8.4238777161, -9.8005418777, -9.8192214966, -10.0350418091, -10.1091547012, -10.8969764709, -11.7857999802, -12.5021896362, -13.0254125595], "content": "No potential con\ufb02ict of interest was reported by the authors.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.7094942927, "detect_cls": "Reference text", "detect_score": -3.9888226986}, {"pdf_name": "604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 13, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf_13_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 544.252, 742.677], "bounding_box": [100.0, 1420.0, 291.0, 1440.0], "classes": ["Section Header", "Page Footer", "Body Text", "Equation label", "Other", "Table Note", "Reference text", "Figure", "Table Caption", "Abstract", "Figure Caption", "Table", "Page Header", "Equation"], "scores": [-2.2776026726, -3.5716822147, -3.9461448193, -4.4812955856, -4.9813704491, -5.7185258865, -5.9750175476, -6.3641672134, -7.4500050545, -7.4941692352, -7.5962486267, -7.718328476, -7.7296071053, -8.5454940796], "content": "Acknowledgement", "postprocess_cls": "Section Header", "postprocess_score": 0.9984427094, "detect_cls": "Section Header", "detect_score": -2.2776026726}, {"pdf_name": "604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 13, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf_13_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 544.252, 742.677], "bounding_box": [101.0, 1474.0, 1305.0, 1522.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Abstract", "Section Header", "Other", "Reference text", "Table Note", "Figure Caption", "Page Footer", "Table Caption", "Equation label", "Page Header", "Figure", "Table", "Equation"], "scores": [-5.0917358398, -6.9154849052, -8.4459562302, -8.6801939011, -9.2087478638, -11.479886055, -12.2791471481, -13.547164917, -14.3159685135, -14.7165603638, -14.8277578354, -14.8470983505, -16.0467815399, -18.7100582123], "content": "This project is partially supported by NIH grant R01 AI087135 and the Center for Big Data in Health Sciences (CBD-HS) at School of Public Health, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, UTHealth).", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9756345153, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -5.0917358398}, {"pdf_name": "604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 13, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/604fdb653f2ac7e70121dedb.pdf_13_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 544.252, 742.677], "bounding_box": [100.0, 1557.0, 440.0, 1577.0], "classes": ["Section Header", "Body Text", "Page Footer", "Page Header", "Equation label", "Reference text", "Figure", "Other", "Figure Caption", "Table Note", "Equation", "Abstract", "Table Caption", "Table"], "scores": [-0.6163724065, -3.1432044506, -5.2765221596, -6.6067113876, -6.6800718307, -6.8246684074, -7.0172939301, -7.1570968628, -8.4932355881, -9.0722942352, -9.492565155, -9.7825870514, -10.5988874435, -10.7026786804], "content": "Appendix A.
