\section{Model Information}
\subsection{Model Description}
The JHUAPL-Bucky model is a COVID-19 metapopulation compartment model initially designed to estimate medium-term (on the order of weeks) case incidence and healthcare usage at the second administrative (admin-2, ADM2) level (counties in the United States; cities or districts in various countries). These ADM2 regions are all coupled using mobility information to approximate the both inter- and intra-regional contacts between the members of the populations. Using the historical case and death data, local demographic data (see Graph Information), and a set of parameters derived from empirical studies, the model infers a number of localized features (see table below) that are related to spread of COVID-19. Projecting forward in time, Bucky then utilizes an age stratified compartment model to not only estimate the case load but additionally provide outputs relating to the healthcare burden of each locality. These time forecasts are performed a large number of times (Monte Carlo experiments), with each individual simulation using minor modifications to the input parameters at random, scaled to the uncertainty of the estimates. The resulting collection of simulations is then used to obtain probabilistic estimates for all output variables.

\subsubsection{Model Overview}
At its base, the Bucky model is a spatially distributed SEIR model. SEIR models are a class of deterministic models used to model infectious diseases that are spread by person-to-person transmission in a population. The simplest versions of such models are systems of ordinary differential equations and are analysed mathematically [Het89].

Within the context of an SEIR model, disease dynamics are modeled over time by moving the population through a series of compartments (otherwise known as "bins" or "states"). Those states are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item susceptible (S): the fraction of the population that could be potentially subjected to the infection;

  \item exposed (E): the fraction of the population that has been infected but does not show symptoms yet;

  \item infectious (I): the fraction of the population that is infective after the latent period;

  \item recovered (R): The fraction of the population that have been infected and recovered from the infection.

\end{itemize}

The total population is represented by the sum of the compartments. Basic assumptions of this type of model include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Once the model is initialized, no individuals are added to the susceptible group. It follows that births and natural deaths are unaccounted for, migration in/out of the region is frozen for the duration of a simulation, and none of the population has been vaccinated or is immune to the pathogen;

  \item The population within each strata is uniform and each pair of individuals within the strata are equally likely to interact;

  \item The probability of interaction between individuals in the population is not rare;

  \item Once infected, an individual cannot be reinfected with the virus.

\end{itemize}

Note: The compartments $E, I^{\text {asym }}, I^{\text {mild }}, I^{\text {hosp }}, R^{\text {hosp }}$ are gamma-distributed with shape parameters specified in the configuration file.

The Bucky model consists of a collection of coupled and stratified SEIR models. Since COVID-19 exhibits heavily age dependent properties, wherein a majority of severe cases are in older individuals, SEIR models are stratified via the age demographic structure of a geographic region in order to get accurate estimates of case severity and deaths. Additionally, to model the spatial dynamics of COVID spread, we consider a set of SEIR sub-models at the smallest geographic level for which we have appropriate data.

The basic structure of the model is displayed in the diagram above. Age is denoted by index $i$, and geographic regions are denoted by index $j$. Within each strata, Bucky models the susceptible and exposed populations, followed by one of three possible infected states: asymptomatic $\left(I^{\text {asym }}\right)$, mild $\left(I^{\text {mild }}\right)$, and severe $\left(I^{\text {hosp }}\right)$. Members of the population who are either asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms recover from the virus at a rate $\gamma$. Those who exhibit severe symptoms and are in need of healthcare support will either recover after a period of illness at rate $1 / \tau_{i}$ or expire as a result of the virus at rate $\phi_{i} \gamma$.

A critical component of the Bucky model is the parameterization of the model. A number of parameters must be derived and/or estimated from their original data sources. These include, but are not limited to those listed in tables above as well as local estimates of local case doubling time, case reporting rate, case fatality rate, and the case hospitalization rate. Further details of these quantities as well as how they are estimated are given in the Model Input and Output section. All parameter estimation for the model includes the basic assumption that, once estimated and initialized, these parameters remain constant during the simulation period.

Coupling individual age and geographically stratified sub-models occurs across a number of dimensions including disease state. Sub-models are coupled together using both the spatial mobility matrix and age-based contact matrices. Modeling of the overall interaction rates between geographic locations and age groups is an important component in accurately modeling non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). Bucky accounts for the implementation of NPIs (e.g. school closures, border closures, face mask wearing) via modifying either the social contact matrices or the basic reproductive number, $R_{0}$. For further details, see Non-pharmaceutical Interventions.

All together, these components contribute to a model that is adaptable to a number of contexts. Bucky is calibrated to the uncertainties in both the case data and the disease parameters, leading to a model that is robust to both the quality and resolution of available input data.

\subsection{Model Input and Output}
\subsubsection{Input}
The Bucky model uses two main sources of input: the input graph and CDCrecommended parameters.

Input Graph The input graph contains data regarding demographics, geographic information, and historical case information. For details, see Graph Information.

CDC-Recommended Parameters The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention $(\mathrm{CDC})$ has published pandemic planning scenarios [fDCP +20$]$ which contain recommended parameters describing biological and epidemiological parameters. Of these five planning scenarios, Bucky utilizes scenario 5, which contains the CDC's current best estimates for disease severity and transmission. These parameters are described in detail, based on information available from the CDC, and summarized in the table below. CDC-recommended parameters are controlled by parameter files located in the par directory.

\end{center}

Disease Transmission The following parameters describe the transmissibility of the virus. The percentage of infections that are asymptomatic, asym\_frac, refers to the percentage of infections that will never develop symptoms. This is a difficult parameter to estimate due to logistical complications (individuals would need to be tested to ensure they remain asymptomatic while infectious) and because the level of asymptomatic infections varies by age. The best estimate for this parameter is the midpoint between the lower bound of $[\mathrm{BCB}+20]$, the upper bound of $[\mathrm{PTC}+20]$, which corresponds to the estimates from [OT20].

The relative infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals compared to symptomatic individuals rel\_inf asym is calculated using upper and lower bounds on the difference in viral dynamics between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. The lower bound is derived from data indicating that more severe cases have higher viral loads [LYW +20$]$ and a study that indicates symptomatic cases shed for longer and have higher viral loads than asymptomatic cases [NYS+20]. Other studies indicate that both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases have similar duration and viral shedding [LKL+20], which is used as the upper bound.

The final parameter relating to disease transmission is the fraction of transmission prior to symptom onset frac\_trans\_before\_sym which corresponds to the percentage of new cases that were caused by transmission from an individual before they become symptomatic. The lower bound is derived from $[\mathrm{HLW}+20]$, with the upper bound derived from [CGM+20].

Disease Characteristics and Severity The mean serial interval, Ts, is the time in days from exposure to onset of symptoms and is taken from [MCH+20]. The mean generation interval, $\mathrm{Tg}$, is the period of time (in days) between symptom onset for one individual and symptom onset for a person they have infected. This value is from $[\mathrm{HLW}+20]$.

The case fatality ratio (CFR) is the number of individuals who will die of the disease; the case hospitalization-severity ratio (CHR) corresponds to the number of cases that are severe and necessitate hospitalization. Within the context of the United States, this ratio corresponds to the individuals admitted to a hospital. In a context where access to medical care is limited, this ratio corresponds to the ratio of individuals who exhibit severe disease symptoms.

Hospital-related parameters are derived using data from COVID-Net [CDC] and the CDC's Data Collation and Integration for Public Health Event Response (DCIPHER). All data is taken from the period between March 1, 2020 to July 15, 2020 unless otherwise noted. The time it takes from symptom onset to hospitalization in days is denoted by I\_to\_H\_time. The number of days an individual will be hospitalized is H\_TIME. Finally, the number of days between death and reporting is D\_REPORT\_TIME.

\subsubsection{Output}
The Bucky model generates one file per Monte Carlo run. This data is postprocessed to combine data across all dates and simulations. It can then be aggregated at desired geographic levels. A separate file is created for each requested administrative level, with each row indexed by data, admin ID, and quantile. The columns of this output file are described in the tables below.

Aggregated files are placed in subfolder named using the Monte Carlo ID within the specified output directory. Filenames are constructed by appending the aggregation level with the aggregation type (quantiles vs mean). For example, the following file contains quantiles at the national level:

/ output/2020-06-10\_14\_13\_04/adm0\_quantiles.csv

An example output directory structure is shown below:

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2023_03_20_d3e634cc02a6a0c25455g-08(1)}
\end{center}

\subsection{Graph Information}
The Bucky model does not do any data manipulation, smoothing, or correcting to the data it receives from the graph (by design). If data needs to be manipulated or corrected, it should be done before it is placed on the graph.

The graph is created using admin2-level data. If data can not be found at the admin2-level, admin2-level information can be extrapolated using admin2 population and national or state level data (this is expanded upon in the Population Data section).

The following data sources are used to create the graph:

\begin{itemize}
  \item admin2-level shapefile

  \item admin2-level population data stratified by age

  \item Historical admin2-level case and death data

  \item Contact matrix information for the country

  \item Mobility data (or a proxy)

\end{itemize}

All data is placed into a single dataframe, joined by the admin2-level key (e.g., FIPS for United States), with the exception of mobility data (which is used to create edges, not nodes).

\subsubsection{Graph-Level Attributes}
Administrative information is placed on the top graph-level. For example:

'adm1\_key' : 'adm1',

'adm2\_key' : 'adm2',

'adm1\_to\_str' : $\left\{1: r^{\prime} A l a b a m a^{\prime}\right\}, . .$,

'adm0\_name' : 'US',

'start\_date' : '2020-09-25'

NOTE: adm1\_to\_str is a dict with key-value pairs indicating the adm1 names for each adm1 value appearing in the graph.

Contact matrices are also on this level under the key contact\_mats.

\subsubsection{Sample Node}
The following is an example node on the graph for the United States. The rest of the documentation will describe what data is necessary to construct this node.

$(0$,

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2023_03_20_d3e634cc02a6a0c25455g-09}
\end{center}

'Confirmed': 1757.0,

'Deaths': 25.0,

'adm2\_name' : 'Autauga County',

'N\_age\_init' : array $([3364 ., 3423 ., \quad 3882 ., 3755 ., 3173 ., \quad 3705 ., 3461 ., 3628 ., 3616 .$, 3966., 3811., 3927., 3237., 2589., 2311., 3753.]),

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2023_03_20_d3e634cc02a6a0c25455g-10(1)}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Population Data}
Population data should be at a admin2 level and stratified in 16 5-year age bins (if using Prem et al contact matrices):

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2023_03_20_d3e634cc02a6a0c25455g-10}
\end{center}

If population data for an admin2 area is known (i.e. number of total people per admin2), but it is not age-stratified, this data can be extrapolated assuming age-stratified population data exists at some level. For example, assume a country has age-stratified data provided at the national-level. To get the admin2level age data, the data is separated into the 16 bins (as a 1-dimensional array of length 16). These bins are then normalized by dividing by the sum. Then, the fraction of people living in the admin2 is calculated by dividing admin2 population by the total national population. For each district, this fraction is multiplied by the age vector to produce a admin2-level age vector. This vector is placed on the node under the key N\_age\_init.

The total population for an admin2 is placed on the node under the key Population.

\subsubsection{Case Data}
Case data should be at the admin2-level and include cumulative data as of the start date of the simulation and historical data for the 45-day period preceding the start date:

\begin{itemize}
  \item case\_hist: Cumulative historical case data

  \item death\_hist: Cumulative historical death data

\end{itemize}

Historical data is structured as numerical vectors on the node with the keys case\_hist, death\_hist. Historical data for every node must have data points for the 45 days preceding the simulation. If there are known errors in the historical data, they must be corrected before being placed on the graph.

\subsubsection{Contact Matrices}
Currently, contact matrix data is downloaded from here (https:// journals . \href{http://plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005697}{plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005697}), which has contact matrices for 152 countries. If a country does not appear in this dataset, a country culturally close can be substituted (for example, Pakistan's contact rates were used for Afghanistan), or another dataset can be used. If another dataset is used, the contact matrix must be formatted such that it has the same shape as the number of age demographic bins (i.e. if there are 16 bins, the matrix must be of size $16 \times 16$ ).

\subsubsection{Mobility Data}
Mobility data is used to construct the edges of the graph. Mobility data, or a proxy for it, is used to describe the contact rates between counties.

The baseline mobility data shows up as an edge attribute called weight. R0\_frac is a factor that is multiplied with the baseline mobility value to model the effect of NPIs, etc., on mobility. For example, given baseline mobility data from February 2020, R0\_frac would be computed by dividing recent mobility data values with the February 2020 baseline. R0\_frac exists to provide a knob to tune during the simulation to model NPIs.

\subsection{Non-pharmeceutical Interventions}
Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are mitigations, apart from getting vaccinated and taking medicine, that people and communities can take to help slow the spread of communicable diseases. As a vaccine for COVID-19 has yet to be deployed, NPIs are among the best strategies for controlling the spread of the current COVID-19 virus. The structure of the Bucky model allows for the incorporation of NPIs via the modification of a combination of the following : the basic reproduction number, local contact matrices, and inter-regional mobility matrices.

For each country an initial list of NPIs was obtained from the ACAPS COVID-19 Government Measures Dataset (\href{https://data.humdata.org/}{https://data.humdata.org/} dataset/acaps-covid19-government-measures-dataset). This dataset is complemented with additional qualitative information from in-country stakeholders. The estimated compliance level are tailored to specific countries.

\subsubsection{Implementation}
NPIs are categorized and implemented in Bucky based on their classification into three categories:

Contact-Matrix Based NPIs These NPIs are those that effect only certain age groups within the total population. These NPI effect the ratios relating the components of the contact matrices. The NPI that fall under this category are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item School Closure

  \item Shielding Elderly

\end{itemize}

Mobility Based NPI This classification is for those NPI that lead to changes in mobility/movement between administrative districts (as opposed to movement within an administrative district). The NPI that fall under this category are :

\begin{itemize}
  \item Closing of borders, ports, and/or international flights

  \item Restricting inter-regional movement

\end{itemize}

Reproduction Number Based NPI This classification is for those NPI that have an effect on the overall scaling of transmissibility. It encompasses both intra-regional measures to reduce transmission as well as national level initiatives designed to reduce transmission throughout the country. The NPI that fall under this category are :

\begin{itemize}
  \item Social distancing

  \item Face mask wearing

  \item Installation of hand washing stations - Reduction of size of public gatherings

  \item Closing businesses

  \item Partial Lockdown

  \item Awareness campaigns (e.g., vaccination programs)

\end{itemize}

A summary of the NPIs that are currently implemented in Bucky are given in the table below. This table includes the classification, effects, and sources that are currently being used to approximate the effects of various NPI.

With the current implementation, we have the ability to distinguish between the effects of NPI within the categories mentioned above. For the case in which multiple NPI within category III are implemented, we have implemented a value-added approach to calculating their effectiveness in reducing the basic reproduction number. In this case, we calculate the reduction in $R_{0}$ based on the number of NPIs in place. If one NPI is in place, $R_{0}$ is reduced by $40 \%$. If two NPI are in place, $R_{0}$ is reduced by $60 \%$. If three or more NPI are in place, then $R_{0}$ is reduced by $70 \%$.

\section{Visualization Tools}
The Bucky model includes visualization tools for creating line plots with confidence intervals and maps. Maps and plots can be created at the national, state, or county (plots only) level.

\subsection{Plots}
By default (i.e. without additional arguments), bucky.viz.plot creates line plots at the national and state level for the columns daily\_reported\_cases and daily-deaths for the most recently postprocessed simulation data. Historical data can be added using the $--\mathrm{hist}$ flag. For a full list of parameters and options, see TODO linkhere to documentation.

To illustrate the different available geographic levels, example plots are shown below for the United States, California, and California's Riverside county. These plots include historical data and all available confidence intervals.

\subsection{Maps}
In addition to line plots, the Bucky model includes a module for creating map visualizations from simulated data. In order to create maps, the desired admin level must be supplied. Maps can be created daily, weekly, or monthly points throughout the simulation.

For example, to create state-level plots:

./ bmodel viz.map --all\_adm1 --columns cumulative\_reported\_cases\_per\_100k

This will create a map like the one shown below:
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2023_03_20_d3e634cc02a6a0c25455g-15}

The mapping tool uses Matplotlib colormaps, defaulting to Reds. To use a different colormap:

./bmodel viz.map --all\_adm1 --columns cumulative\_reported\_cases\_per\_100k\_-cmap plasma
