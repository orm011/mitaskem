We solve the differential Equations (1) by using a forward Euler finite-difference scheme [e.g., (17)], discretizing the time variable as t = ndt, where n is a natural number and dt is the time step. After discretization, Equations (1) and (2) become:

Sn+1=Sn+dt(Λ−μSn−βSnInNn),En+1=En+dt[βSnInNn−(μ+ϵ)En],In+1=In+dt[ϵEn−(γ+μ+α)In],Rn+1=Rn+dt(γIn−μRn),D˙n=−(S˙n+E˙n+I˙n+R˙n)(t),    (7)
 
where Ḋn is the number of dead people in only the specific day n. This algorithm yields positive and bounded solutions [e.g., see (6) and Problem 1.42(iv) in (8)], and the system converges to an equilibrium, i.e., Sn+Rn+Dn=S∞+R∞+D∞=N0
 for t → ∞.

4. Results
Let us consider the following base parameters as an example so as to analyze the results by varying some of them. N0 = 10 million, α = 0.006/day, β = 0.75/day, γ = (1/8)/day, ϵ = (1/3)/day, Λ = μN (balance of births and natural deaths), and initial conditions: S(0) = N0 − E(0) − I(0), E(0) = 20,000, I(0) = 1 and R(0) = 0. These data are taken from Chowell et al. [(3), Table 1] for SARS and imply an average disease incubation (latent period) of 3 days and an infectious period of 8 days. The data correspond to no isolation conditions among individuals and an epidemic situation (high β, R0 = 5.72> 1).
