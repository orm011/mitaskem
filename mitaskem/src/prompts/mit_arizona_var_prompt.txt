I have some variables extracted from a paper with ID, name, and the discription of the varible:

[MIT]

Then I have another version of the same paper with the same ID, name, and the discription of the varible:

[ARIZONA]

Can you find the best match from the second version of variable extraction for each variable in the first variable extraction?
If it does, print the ID mapping of these variables, one on each line. Started with ID from first variable extraction, print a colon, followed by ID from the second variable extraction.
