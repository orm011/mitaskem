We have a list of variable names and initial values for lines of code in a Python program.The list has [VLEN] elements
[VAR]
There is also an ontology which has [TLEN] items:
ontology = [TERMS]
Some code elements have a matching element in the ontology. For example,
(s_n, 1000) matches 'population'
(relative_contact_rate, 005) matches 'number contacts'
Which element is the best match for [TARGET]?
